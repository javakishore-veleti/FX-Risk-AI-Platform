# Decision Records Overview

This folder contains structured records of key decisions made during the architecture, strategy, and implementation of the Fx-Risk-AI Platform. These records provide traceability, clarity, and institutional memory across all levels of the initiative — from platform infrastructure to enterprise transformation goals.

## Purpose

The goal of maintaining decision records is to:

- Document important decisions in a consistent, reviewable format
- Clarify rationale and tradeoffs at the time of each choice
- Support onboarding and cross-team alignment
- Provide an audit trail for compliance and architectural traceability

## Record Types

This folder is organized into subcategories for clarity:

| Folder                     | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `architecture-decisions/` | Contains ADRs (Architecture Decision Records) documenting technical choices |
| `strategy-decisions/`     | Contains SIRs, TDRs, GDRs — strategic decisions from CIO/CTO-level leaders  |
| `retired/`                | Stores deprecated or superseded decisions for historical reference          |

## Decision Types Explained

| Type | Owner            | Description |
|------|------------------|-------------|
| ADR  | Chief Architect  | Technical decisions such as service architecture, tool adoption, or data modeling |
| SIR  | CIO              | Strategic initiatives such as LLM rollout, SLA intelligence, or audit transformation |
| TDR  | CTO              | Technology direction such as platform standardization or cloud strategy              |
| GDR  | CIO / CTO        | Governance policies including audit logging, explainability, and compliance         |

## How to Use

- Each decision file is named with a unique ID and stored in its respective folder.
- Use the headers in each file to understand the context, rationale, and impact.
- Related decisions should cross-reference one another where applicable.
- To change a decision, create a new file that supersedes the previous one — do not overwrite history.

## Cross-Referencing

Each decision type contributes to a traceable framework:

- SIRs define business-aligned strategic initiatives
- TDRs capture platform-wide technical directions
- GDRs codify governance and compliance mandates
- ADRs document concrete architectural and implementation decisions

Together, these provide full-spectrum traceability from business strategy to system behavior.

## Access and Review

All records are maintained in version control and reviewed as part of the platform’s governance process. When introducing a new decision, use the provided templates and submit through an appropriate change control or pull request process.
