# ADR-050: Controlled AI Feature Flagging and Rollout Strategy

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD  
**Deciders**: Chief Architect, AI Product Owner, Release Engineering Lead  
**Context Level**: AI Delivery, Governance, Experimentation Strategy

## Context

As AI-powered features become increasingly embedded into enterprise platforms, their experimental nature and impact require **controlled rollout mechanisms**. Risks without such controls include:

- Unexpected behavior in production environments  
- Model performance inconsistencies across users or datasets  
- Business disruptions due to broad untested rollouts  
- Difficulty gathering usage feedback by user segment

Borrowing from software engineering practices, AI features must be governed with **feature flagging**, targeted deployment, and observability mechanisms.

## Decision

Implement a **Feature Flagging and Rollout Strategy** for all AI-enabled features, models, and workflows.

### Strategy Components:

1. **Feature Flag Infrastructure**  
   - Use open-source (e.g., Unleash, Flagsmith) or enterprise solutions (e.g., LaunchDarkly)  
   - Maintain environment-aware flag definitions (`dev`, `test`, `prod`)

2. **Targeting and Segmentation**  
   - Flags scoped by user role, team, region, or account type  
   - Experiment cohort definitions for A/B or canary releases

3. **Observability and Metrics**  
   - Monitor flag-enabled usage, conversion, and error rates  
   - Link feature flags with prompt/model/embedding version for full traceability

4. **Kill Switch and Rollback**  
   - All AI features must have real-time disable capability  
   - Emergency rollback paths documented and tested

5. **Change Governance**  
   - Feature flag updates go through PR reviews with deployment approvals  
   - Flags tagged with business owners, rollout plans, and expiration timelines

## Rationale

- **CIO Alignment**: Supports compliance by enabling phased exposure and audit controls  
- **CTO Alignment**: Enables faster, safer AI delivery without blocking development velocity  
- **Chief Architect Alignment**: Promotes modular, observable, and reversible design for AI features

## Consequences

### Benefits

- Reduces AI-related incidents from untested feature releases  
- Enables experimentation and gradual exposure with minimal risk  
- Improves A/B testing capability and business impact measurement  
- Helps isolate bugs and performance regressions tied to AI behavior

### Trade-Offs

- Requires discipline in flag management and expiration  
- Slight increase in implementation complexity and testing matrix  
- Overuse of flags can lead to “flag debt” if not reviewed regularly

## Alternatives Considered

- Hard-coded enablement by environment  
  → Inflexible and cannot support user or region-specific exposure.

- Manual rollback via redeployment  
  → Slow and risky in high-stakes business processes.

## Lifecycle and Governance

- Flags registered in a central service or manifest  
- Expiration policies enforce cleanup after productization  
- Flag audit reports generated monthly by release team  
- Feature flag performance correlated with downstream metrics in dashboards
