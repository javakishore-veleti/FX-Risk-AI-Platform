# ADR-016: Multi-Account AWS Strategy for Platform Isolation and Compliance

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD  
**Deciders**: Chief Architect, Cloud Platform Lead, CISO, CTO  
**Context Level**: Cloud Infrastructure Strategy, Security, and Operational Governance

## Context

As the enterprise platform matures, consolidating all environments and services into a single AWS account creates limitations:

- **Security Risk**: Lack of blast radius containment across modules and teams  
- **IAM Entanglement**: Overlapping privileges, difficulty auditing role boundaries  
- **Compliance Gaps**: No isolation between production, staging, and sandbox workloads  
- **Deployment Coupling**: Hard to apply service-level change policies or quotas independently

Cloud-native best practices recommend account-level separation for modularity, access control, and billing transparency.

## Decision

Adopt a **multi-account AWS strategy** using **AWS Organizations**, enabling account isolation by:

- Environment (e.g., dev, staging, prod)  
- Domain or bounded context (e.g., AI pipelines, data lake, orchestration, frontend)  
- Team ownership or regulatory scope (e.g., US-only, sandbox, high-risk LLM flows)

Key practices include SCPs (Service Control Policies), consolidated billing, cross-account roles, and CloudTrail centralization.

## Rationale

- **CIO Alignment**: Enables compliance zones, spend reporting by unit, and platform accountability  
- **CTO Alignment**: Supports DevSecOps workflows, CI/CD lane isolation, and quota management  
- **Chief Architect Alignment**: Maps directly to BDAT modular domains and reduces service blast radius

## Consequences

### Benefits

- **Security Isolation**: Misconfigurations in one account do not affect others  
- **Operational Segregation**: Teams have autonomy with guardrails  
- **Audit Clarity**: Logs and permissions are easier to reason about by domain  
- **Policy Customization**: SCPs and IAM controls can be fine-tuned per account

### Trade-Offs

- **Setup Complexity**: Requires automated org setup, account vending, and cross-account roles  
- **IAM Management**: Role trust policies must be coordinated across environments  
- **Resource Duplication**: Shared services (e.g., S3 buckets, VPCs) may be duplicated across accounts

## Alternatives Considered

- **Single Account Model**  
  Simplifies management but increases coupling, risk, and audit burden.

- **Team-Owned Accounts Without Central Governance**  
  Causes inconsistency, drift, and cloud sprawl.

## Lifecycle and Governance

- New accounts must be provisioned via an automated, approved pipeline  
- SCPs must restrict risky services (e.g., IAM * permissions, unapproved regions)  
- Centralized logging, billing, and alerting must aggregate across accounts  
- Cross-account access must follow the principle of least privilege and be reviewed quarterly
