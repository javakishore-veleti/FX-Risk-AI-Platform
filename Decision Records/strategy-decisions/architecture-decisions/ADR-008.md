# ADR-008: Prompt Registry as Git-Tracked Infrastructure

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD  
**Deciders**: Chief Architect, Head of AI/ML, DevOps Lead  
**Context Level**: AI Platform Governance and Prompt Lifecycle Management

## Context

As generative AI models are integrated into enterprise workflows, prompt engineering becomes a critical component of system logic. However, unmanaged prompts introduce challenges:

- Lack of versioning or change tracking  
- Inability to audit or explain LLM behavior  
- No standardization for reuse across domains  
- Difficult to validate or A/B test prompt modifications

In regulated or high-stakes environments, prompt evolution must follow the same rigor as source code or infrastructure definitions.

## Decision

Treat prompts as **first-class infrastructure artifacts**, stored in Git with explicit versioning, metadata, and review workflows. Prompts will be defined as `.prompt.md` or `.prompt.yaml` files, each with:

- A unique `prompt_id`  
- Template variables with schema  
- Usage description and domain  
- Version and authorship metadata  
- Audit labels and fallback options (if applicable)

## Rationale

- **CIO Alignment**: Enables full auditability, traceability, and compliance readiness for AI-assisted actions  
- **CTO Alignment**: Provides a single source of truth for runtime prompt content and allows CI-integrated validation  
- **Chief Architect Alignment**: Enforces modularity, version control, and cross-domain reuse in the AI orchestration layer

## Consequences

### Benefits

- **Traceability**: All prompt executions can be linked to a version-controlled artifact  
- **Reviewability**: Prompts can be peer-reviewed via pull requests and documentation  
- **Experimentation**: Enables A/B testing and controlled rollout of prompt variants  
- **Reusability**: Prompts can be shared across workflows, improving consistency

### Trade-Offs

- **Operational Discipline**: Teams must adopt prompt hygiene and adhere to formatting and metadata rules  
- **Tooling Overhead**: Requires validation scripts, testing frameworks, and runtime prompt loaders  
- **Initial Learning Curve**: Teams unfamiliar with prompt engineering must be trained on structure, tone, and risk mitigation

## Alternatives Considered

- **Inline Prompting in Code**  
  Quick but brittle, lacks visibility, and difficult to audit or update independently.

- **External Prompt Management SaaS Tools**  
  Useful for experimentation but often lack Git integration, version traceability, and security alignment with enterprise infra.

## Lifecycle and Governance

- All production prompts must be committed via structured PRs and undergo code review  
- A registry of approved prompts will be generated from the Git repo and published to platform runtime environments  
- Prompt metadata must include domain tags, ownership, intended use cases, and deprecation markers
