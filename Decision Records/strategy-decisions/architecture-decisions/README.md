# Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

This folder contains formal Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) that document significant architectural decisions made across the platform. Each ADR includes the context, decision, rationale, consequences, and lifecycle considerations that reflect a deliberate, governed approach to enterprise systems design.

## Purpose

- Track architectural evolution transparently  
- Enable governance, review, and justification for critical choices  
- Align with enterprise roles (CIO, CTO, Chief Architect) and platform BDAT principles  
- Provide future teams with context and reasoning behind architectural commitments

## Scope

These ADRs apply across domains including:

- Modular platform architecture  
- AI/ML orchestration  
- Security, compliance, and IAM patterns  
- Forecasting and capacity planning  
- Observability, policy-as-code, and auditability  
- Reusable services and data governance
