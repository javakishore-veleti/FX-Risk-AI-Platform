# ADR-002: Orchestration via AWS Step Functions

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD  
**Deciders**: Chief Architect, CTO  
**Context Level**: Platform Runtime Orchestration & Workflow Integration

## Context

Modern enterprise platforms often need to orchestrate a wide variety of services—APIs, data flows, AI workflows, human review steps, and condition-based execution. These workflows often involve:

- Hybrid workloads (e.g., LLM + rule engines + legacy APIs)  
- Branching logic, retry policies, and timeout handling  
- Visibility and traceability across steps for debugging and audit

Previous orchestration patterns using custom code or chained APIs proved to be brittle, hard to maintain, and inconsistent in observability and error handling.

## Decision

Standardize on **AWS Step Functions** as the orchestration layer for all structured, multi-step, conditional execution paths across platform services, including AI-based workflows.

### Use Case Patterns

- Exception handling pipelines (triage → resolution → notification)  
- Multi-stage AI inference with grounding, model invocation, and postprocessing  
- Human-in-the-loop review and fallback sequences  
- Event-based triggers (e.g., forecast change → rerun inference → send report)

## Rationale

- **CIO Alignment**: Provides visibility into process SLAs, reduces failures from manual coordination, and supports operational audit needs  
- **CTO Alignment**: Reduces custom glue code, enforces operational policies (timeouts, retries), and integrates with AWS-native services  
- **Chief Architect Alignment**: Brings runtime workflows into declarative, version-controlled, testable, and observable state machines

## Consequences

### Benefits

- **Visual Representation**: Enables both technical and non-technical stakeholders to review flow logic  
- **Error Handling**: Built-in support for retries, catch blocks, timeouts, and fallbacks  
- **Observability**: Native integration with CloudWatch, X-Ray, and trace logs per execution  
- **Extensibility**: Easily integrates with Lambda, EventBridge, Bedrock, ECS, and SQS

### Drawbacks

- **Learning Curve**: Requires understanding of ASL (Amazon States Language)  
- **Complexity Overhead**: For simple sequences, Step Functions may be overkill  
- **AWS Lock-In**: Architecture is tightly coupled to AWS; abstractions may be needed in multi-cloud scenarios

## Alternatives Considered

- **Custom orchestration logic in application code**  
  Simple to implement but lacks reliability, traceability, and centralized monitoring.

- **Apache Airflow / Prefect / Dagster**  
  Strong for data and ML pipelines but not as tightly integrated into AWS-native operational services.

- **Event-driven architecture only (e.g., SQS, SNS)**  
  Lightweight and decoupled but hard to manage conditional logic, retries, or human interaction.

## Lifecycle and Governance

- All workflows should be described declaratively in version-controlled YAML/JSON  
- Complex orchestration logic must be peer-reviewed via ADR or system design review  
- Tagged and classified by business domain for observability and traceability
