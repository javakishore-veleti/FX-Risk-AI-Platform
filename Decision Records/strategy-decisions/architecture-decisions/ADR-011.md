# ADR-011: Observability Stack (OpenTelemetry + CloudWatch + X-Ray)

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD  
**Deciders**: Chief Architect, SRE Lead, CTO  
**Context Level**: Platform Observability, Telemetry, and Operations Strategy

## Context

As the platform spans multiple microservices, AI inference flows, data pipelines, and orchestration layers, reliable observability becomes critical for:

- Debugging latency and failure in real-time and batch workloads  
- Tracing user-initiated workflows across frontend, backend, and AI components  
- Monitoring SLA violations and triggering proactive alerting  
- Supporting audit, compliance, and anomaly detection for LLM behaviors and service health

Historically, teams used a mix of ad hoc logs, service-specific metrics, and minimal tracing. This led to fragmented visibility, manual root-cause analysis, and low confidence in performance benchmarks.

## Decision

Adopt a unified observability stack composed of:

- **OpenTelemetry** for structured instrumentation and distributed tracing  
- **Amazon CloudWatch** for centralized logs, metrics, and alarms  
- **AWS X-Ray** for request-scoped tracing across Lambda, Step Functions, API Gateway, and ECS/EKS services

This stack will be used across backend services, orchestration layers, AI endpoints, and API gateways.

## Rationale

- **CIO Alignment**: Improves visibility into SLA compliance, operational KPIs, and system uptime  
- **CTO Alignment**: Enables proactive fault detection, dashboarding, and SRE workflows  
- **Chief Architect Alignment**: Establishes observability as a platform-wide capability layered into BDAT architecture

## Consequences

### Benefits

- **End-to-End Tracing**: Follows a request from user interaction to data access, LLM inference, and response generation  
- **Unified Logging**: All logs conform to structured format (JSON) with correlation IDs and trace IDs  
- **Flexible Telemetry**: OpenTelemetry supports standardization across cloud providers and SDKs  
- **Alerting and Dashboards**: CloudWatch Alarms and Metrics provide visibility for Ops, Risk, and Engineering teams

### Trade-Offs

- **Instrumentation Overhead**: Requires developers to tag spans, propagate headers, and adopt tracing libraries  
- **Learning Curve**: Teams need training on span structures, log enrichment, and correlation workflows  
- **Cost Considerations**: Large-scale logs and metrics must be sampled or tiered to optimize cost

## Alternatives Considered

- **Custom Logging and Metrics per Service**  
  Inconsistent, harder to query, and difficult to debug across service boundaries.

- **Third-party APM tools (e.g., Datadog, New Relic)**  
  Feature-rich, but may introduce licensing complexity and overlap with AWS-native services.

## Lifecycle and Governance

- All services must emit OpenTelemetry-compatible traces, logs, and metrics  
- Trace context must be passed across internal services and external-facing APIs  
- Dashboards for key workflows must include latency, error rate, and retry patterns  
- An observability review must be part of every new serviceâ€™s architecture review
