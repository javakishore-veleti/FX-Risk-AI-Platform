# ADR-055: LLM-Aware API Gateway Design for Enterprise AI Services

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD  
**Deciders**: Chief Architect, API Platform Lead, AI Security Officer  
**Context Level**: Infrastructure Architecture, AI Delivery, API Governance

## Context

As LLM-based capabilities are exposed via APIs for internal teams and external consumers, traditional API gateways may fall short in addressing:

- AI-specific traffic patterns (e.g., streaming, batch, async)  
- Prompt injection or input validation threats  
- Payload observability for prompts and responses  
- Cost control tied to token usage or model latency  
- Versioning and traceability of LLM artifacts per request

Enterprise AI platforms require a **purpose-designed API Gateway** that understands and manages LLM workflows at runtime.

## Decision

Design and deploy an **LLM-Aware API Gateway Layer** as a standardized entry point for all LLM-related inference and orchestration APIs.

### Key Features:

1. **Prompt and Response Payload Filtering**  
   - Validate inputs for injection risks, length, structure  
   - Post-process responses for compliance violations or formatting issues

2. **Metadata Injection and Tracing**  
   - Inject request-level tags: user ID, prompt version, model ID, embedding namespace  
   - Correlate with observability pipelines and audit logs

3. **Rate Limiting and Quota Enforcement**  
   - Per-team or per-tenant quotas based on cost proxies (e.g., token counts, GPU time)  
   - Adaptive throttling for burst scenarios

4. **Streaming and Async Support**  
   - Proxy both synchronous and streamed LLM responses (e.g., SSE, WebSockets)  
   - Support long-running jobs with callback URLs or webhooks

5. **Versioned Endpoints and Canary Routing**  
   - Allow traffic to be directed by model version, user role, or feature flag  
   - Enable controlled rollout of new LLM backends

## Rationale

- **CIO Alignment**: Central governance point for exposure, audit, and SLA enforcement  
- **CTO Alignment**: Unified access and operational control across AI service tiers  
- **Chief Architect Alignment**: Codifies AI-native controls into gateway and platform fabric

## Consequences

### Benefits

- Prevents misuse or overuse of costly LLM APIs  
- Enables fine-grained access control and telemetry  
- Improves developer experience and platform reliability  
- Reduces security risk from malformed or adversarial prompt payloads

### Trade-Offs

- Requires specialized logic and observability beyond traditional gateways  
- Increases complexity in API layer and deployment pipelines  
- Tight integration needed with feature flags and model registries

## Alternatives Considered

- Reuse existing API Gateway with generic rules  
  → Lacks understanding of LLM-specific security and observability needs.

- Client-side validation and versioning only  
  → Inconsistent enforcement, less secure, harder to audit centrally.

## Lifecycle and Governance

- Managed by API Platform Team in collaboration with AI Platform Group  
- LLM-specific policies written as plugins or filters in gateway stack (e.g., Envoy, Kong)  
- Monthly audits of usage logs, version mappings, and token-based billing  
- Change approvals reviewed by platform governance board
