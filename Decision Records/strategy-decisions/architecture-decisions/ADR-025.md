# ADR-025: Runtimes as Composable Units (FaaS, Containers, Jobs)

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD  
**Deciders**: Chief Architect, Platform Engineering, DevOps Lead  
**Context Level**: Execution Architecture, Workload Abstractions, and Platform Runtime Strategy

## Context

Modern platforms operate across a spectrum of execution patterns—ranging from real-time APIs to scheduled jobs, event-driven handlers, and asynchronous pipelines. These workloads vary significantly in:

- Latency and throughput requirements  
- Deployment lifecycle and frequency  
- Scalability characteristics and cost models  
- Integration with orchestration engines (e.g., AWS Step Functions, Airflow, Kube jobs)

Without a modular runtime abstraction, engineering teams struggle to:

- Choose the appropriate compute model for their use case  
- Reuse infrastructure patterns and observability instrumentation  
- Coordinate long-running processes and retries with reliability

## Decision

Adopt the principle of **Runtimes as Composable Units**, standardizing three canonical execution forms:

1. **FaaS (Functions-as-a-Service)** — short-lived, reactive handlers for events, triggers, and glue logic  
2. **Containers (Long-running APIs or Services)** — persistent interfaces for APIs, gateways, model servers  
3. **Batch Jobs / Pipelines** — scheduled or on-demand jobs for heavy data/AI workloads or model training

Each runtime will have:

- A baseline scaffolding (CAF) with telemetry, IAM policies, and health probes  
- Standardized deployment lanes (IaC templates, GitOps pipelines)  
- Tagging and metadata to track domain, version, sensitivity, and lifecycle state  
- Logging and metric propagation patterns appropriate to their execution model

## Rationale

- **CIO Alignment**: Enables cost-conscious workload placement and resource optimization  
- **CTO Alignment**: Supports a spectrum of delivery models without sacrificing governance  
- **Chief Architect Alignment**: Encourages composability, reuse, and runtime abstraction across platform

## Consequences

### Benefits

- **Separation of Concerns**: Match execution mode to use case without rewriting core logic  
- **Scalability**: FaaS for bursty compute, containers for stable APIs, jobs for heavy AI/data lifting  
- **Operational Reusability**: Standard CI/CD, IAM, telemetry, and logging applied to all runtimes  
- **Platform Evolution**: Runtimes evolve independently while adhering to the same lifecycle principles

### Trade-Offs

- **Policy Variants**: IAM roles, timeouts, logging may differ slightly across runtimes  
- **Developer Training**: Teams must learn multiple execution patterns and when to apply them  
- **Observability Complexity**: Cross-runtime tracing requires consistent correlation ID propagation

## Alternatives Considered

- **Uniform Containerization**  
  Simpler tooling, but forces every workload into long-running models—even short-lived triggers.

- **Single Orchestration Engine (e.g., Kubernetes for All)**  
  Powerful, but burdensome for small workflows; lacks native semantics for jobs or serverless.

## Lifecycle and Governance

- New workloads must declare their runtime classification and be evaluated accordingly  
- Runtime scaffolds and CI templates are versioned and maintained by platform engineering  
- Observability, cost tracking, and tagging are mandatory across all runtime classes  
- Runtime choices will be reviewed during architecture intake and domain solutioning
