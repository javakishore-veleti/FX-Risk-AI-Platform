# ADR-042: Multi-Tenant Logical Isolation in Shared Environments

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD  
**Deciders**: Chief Architect, Cloud Security Lead, DevOps Governance Board  
**Context Level**: Cloud Architecture, Platform Scalability, Security

## Context

As more business units, regions, or customer desks adopt shared AI and analytics platforms, ensuring **multi-tenant isolation** becomes crucial. Without strict boundaries, risks include:

- Data leakage across tenants or desks  
- Inconsistent enforcement of quotas, policies, and controls  
- Operational debugging complexity  
- Regulatory compliance violations

Rather than creating fully separate infrastructure for each team (which increases cost and complexity), logical isolation within shared environments must be implemented and governed.

## Decision

Implement **Logical Multi-Tenant Isolation** in shared cloud and AI environments via the following strategy:

### Core Components:

1. **Namespace or Account Separation**  
   - Each tenant (e.g., business unit, region) has logically isolated namespace in Kubernetes, cloud account/subscription, or data workspace

2. **IAM Role Segmentation**  
   - Policies enforce least-privilege access by namespace and resource group  
   - Data engineers and ML developers cannot see or access other tenants’ resources

3. **Quota Enforcement**  
   - CPU, memory, GPU, storage limits defined per tenant  
   - Burst and overage policies managed centrally

4. **Logging and Audit Partitioning**  
   - Logs are labeled and routed per tenant with searchable tags  
   - Audit trails (e.g., access logs, inference requests) support tenant-level traceability

5. **Data Encryption Boundaries**  
   - At-rest and in-transit encryption enforced with tenant-specific keys or KMS policies  
   - Shared features or embeddings are read-only and scrubbed of PII

## Rationale

- **CIO Alignment**: Protects enterprise and customer data while supporting shared innovation  
- **CTO Alignment**: Enables scalable onboarding of new teams without duplicating infrastructure  
- **Chief Architect Alignment**: Preserves architectural integrity and maintainability

## Consequences

### Benefits

- Scalable, secure multi-tenant model with minimal duplication  
- Clear operational ownership and support boundaries  
- Enables chargeback and usage visibility per tenant  
- Supports regional data residency and compliance strategies

### Trade-Offs

- Slight complexity in access and policy management  
- Requires robust monitoring and role provisioning automation  
- May not satisfy strict physical isolation requirements (e.g., for high-risk financial data)

## Alternatives Considered

- Fully isolated stack per tenant (infra, storage, compute)  
  → Secure but costly and operationally burdensome.

- Flat shared environment with no boundaries  
  → Inexpensive but dangerous from a security and compliance standpoint.

## Lifecycle and Governance

- Tenant onboarding managed via platform intake workflow  
- Policy-as-code ensures reproducibility and auditability  
- Quotas and usage monitored via observability stack  
- Regular tenant review and cleanup for dormant resources
