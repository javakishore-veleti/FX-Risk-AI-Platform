# ADR-029: Encryption Strategy for Data-at-Rest and In-Transit

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD  
**Deciders**: Chief Architect, CISO, Cloud Security Engineer  
**Context Level**: Data Protection, Cloud Security Architecture, Compliance

## Context

Data within modern cloud-native architectures must be protected both while stored (at-rest) and during transmission (in-transit). With multiple services exchanging sensitive business, customer, and AI-derived information, encryption is a foundational layer of defense.

Compliance regimes (e.g., SOC2, HIPAA, ISO 27001) require end-to-end encryption, key lifecycle management, and demonstrable auditability. Risks of data leakage, lateral movement, or misconfigured services are compounded by multi-cloud or hybrid environments.

## Decision

Adopt a **uniform encryption strategy** that includes:

1. **Data-at-Rest Encryption (Default)**  
   - Enforced at the storage layer (e.g., S3, EBS, RDS, Azure Storage, GCS)  
   - Keys managed by KMS or customer-managed key hierarchies (CMKs)

2. **Data-in-Transit Encryption**  
   - Enforced via HTTPS/TLS 1.2+ across all APIs, pipelines, messaging, and third-party integrations  
   - Certificate management automated with ACM or Azure Key Vault + rotation policies

3. **Key Management Policies**  
   - Rotation, tagging, and access control via KMS, Key Vault, or CloudHSM  
   - Separation of duties between key admin, usage roles, and logging

4. **Service Config Templates**  
   - IaC patterns to ensure encryption flags are explicitly declared and version-controlled

## Rationale

- **CIO Alignment**: Demonstrates alignment with regulatory standards and customer trust requirements  
- **CTO Alignment**: Reduces incident exposure and simplifies security audits  
- **Chief Architect Alignment**: Codifies security by default into the platform's technical baseline

## Consequences

### Benefits

- **Compliance Ready**: Consistent encryption posture across data layers and pipelines  
- **Key Lifecycle Control**: Auditable policies for rotation, revocation, and access control  
- **Default Secure**: All new services inherit encryption from IaC or config standards  
- **Cloud-Native Integration**: Uses first-party tools with native observability and policy support

### Trade-Offs

- **Operational Complexity**: Requires education and automation around key permissions and usage  
- **Cost Implications**: Customer-managed CMKs may incur additional cost and management overhead  
- **Performance Impact**: Minimal but measurable encryption overhead in high-throughput systems

## Alternatives Considered

- **Selective Encryption Based on Sensitivity**  
  May reduce operational overhead but increases risk and governance complexity.

- **Use of Self-Managed Key Infrastructure**  
  Provides more control but adds significant burden in terms of uptime, HSM maintenance, and audit tooling.

## Lifecycle and Governance

- Keys tagged with owner, purpose, sensitivity, and expiry metadata  
- Encryption posture verified via CI checks and runtime config scanners  
- Incident playbooks include key compromise, rotation, and revocation steps  
- Dashboards track encrypted resource % coverage and key access logs
