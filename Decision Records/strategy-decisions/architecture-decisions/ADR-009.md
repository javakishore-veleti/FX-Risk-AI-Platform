# ADR-009: Traceability Strategy for LLM and Hybrid Workflows

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD  
**Deciders**: Chief Architect, Head of AI/ML, Chief Risk Officer  
**Context Level**: AI Systems Governance and Audit Architecture

## Context

As platforms embed LLMs into operational workflows—such as exception handling, summarization, classification, and routing—enterprises must ensure all AI-assisted actions are:

- Explainable to internal teams and auditors  
- Auditable in the face of regulatory or stakeholder reviews  
- Versioned and reproducible for consistency and rollback  
- Secure and role-governed to prevent unintended leakage or misuse

This is especially critical for **hybrid workflows** that combine business rules, retrieval logic, and generative AI.

## Decision

Implement a **comprehensive traceability layer** for all AI workflows, whether rule-driven, LLM-based, or hybrid, including:

- Unique execution trace ID per user or workflow session  
- Logging of all prompt IDs, model IDs, retrieval input sources, and intermediate outputs  
- Tagged lineage of data transformations, API interactions, and fallback paths  
- Role- and domain-aware trace tagging to separate sensitive vs. public logs

## Rationale

- **CIO Alignment**: Ensures auditability, supports internal/external compliance reviews, and builds trust in AI adoption  
- **CTO Alignment**: Enables observability, debugging, and root-cause analysis of LLM and rule orchestration  
- **Chief Architect Alignment**: Embeds traceability as a foundational non-functional requirement across BDAT layers

## Consequences

### Benefits

- **Audit-Ready Logs**: Each user interaction or automation can be traced to a verifiable decision path  
- **Explainability-by-Design**: Enables drill-down into prompt content, retrieved documents, and system decisions  
- **Governance Integration**: Supports regulatory labeling, retention policies, and IAM-controlled log access  
- **Security Enforcement**: Trace data can be scoped by tenant, user, and business unit

### Trade-Offs

- **Increased Logging Overhead**: Must balance observability with cost, privacy, and performance  
- **Instrumentation Effort**: Requires standardized wrappers for prompt execution, retrievers, and workflow handlers  
- **Cross-Team Coordination**: Developers, ML engineers, and audit leads must align on what’s required

## Alternatives Considered

- **Ad-hoc Logging**  
  Common in early-stage projects but fails under scale, and lacks structure or policy compliance.

- **Black-box LLM APIs without wrappers**  
  Fast to ship, but prohibits traceability and poses risks in regulated environments.

## Lifecycle and Governance

- All AI workflows must use a standard trace context and logging schema  
- Trace logs should be partitioned by domain, retention tier, and compliance label  
- Governance policies must define minimum logging granularity and log viewer access levels
