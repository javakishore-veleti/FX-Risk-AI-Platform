# ADR-031: Unified Telemetry Schema Across Logs, Traces, and Metrics

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD  
**Deciders**: Chief Architect, Observability Lead, DevOps Engineering  
**Context Level**: Platform Observability Architecture

## Context

As distributed systems grow in complexity, ensuring full observability across services becomes essential. Currently, logs, traces, and metrics are emitted in isolated formats, making correlation across telemetry sources difficult.

- Logs contain business and exception context but lack trace IDs.
- Traces provide latency and dependency graphs but are underutilized.
- Metrics support alerting but miss contextual payloads.

Without a unifying schema, platform teams struggle to debug, optimize, and audit systems—especially when failures involve multiple domains (e.g., data ingestion → AI model → orchestration API).

## Decision

Adopt a **Unified Telemetry Schema** built around OpenTelemetry (OTel) standards to ensure consistent propagation of metadata across logs, traces, and metrics:

1. **Trace Context Propagation**  
   - All services must propagate `trace_id`, `span_id`, and `parent_id` headers
   - Standard HTTP headers (`traceparent`, `tracestate`) are enforced

2. **Structured Logging**  
   - Logs must emit as structured JSON with fields like `trace_id`, `service_name`, `log_level`, `operation`, `error_code`

3. **Metrics Tags Alignment**  
   - All metrics must include common labels: `service_name`, `env`, `operation`, `trace_id` (where applicable)

4. **Auto-Instrumentation Support**  
   - Encourage usage of SDKs for automatic span creation and log enrichment in Python, Node.js, Java, etc.

5. **Telemetry Pipeline Integration**  
   - Logs → OpenSearch/S3  
   - Traces → AWS X-Ray, Azure Monitor, or Jaeger  
   - Metrics → Prometheus/Grafana/CloudWatch/Datadog

## Rationale

- **CIO Alignment**: Ensures auditability and postmortem traceability for compliance and service health  
- **CTO Alignment**: Accelerates RCA (Root Cause Analysis) and performance tuning  
- **Chief Architect Alignment**: Codifies standard observability practices into every component

## Consequences

### Benefits

- Cross-domain debugging becomes feasible through trace correlation
- Alerting dashboards include log and trace drilldowns
- Developers gain faster feedback on latency and exceptions
- Enables SLO-based alerting and AI-driven ops (e.g., anomaly detection)

### Trade-Offs

- Requires changes to logging format and libraries in all services
- Increases telemetry data volume and storage/ingestion cost
- Developers must adopt and maintain trace propagation discipline

## Alternatives Considered

- Maintain separate telemetry pipelines without standardization  
  → Faster initial setup, but long-term debugging becomes operationally expensive and fragile.

- Manual correlation using partial metadata (e.g., timestamps, user IDs)  
  → Inaccurate and prone to human error.

## Lifecycle and Governance

- Observability team owns schema definitions and trace propagation libraries  
- Dashboards will monitor telemetry coverage by service and domain  
- CI checks and runtime health probes validate trace ID presence and structured log format  
- Periodic architecture reviews ensure new modules adopt and conform to schema
