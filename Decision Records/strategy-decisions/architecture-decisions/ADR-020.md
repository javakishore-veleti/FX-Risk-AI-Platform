# ADR-020: AI Reusability and Shared Service Strategy

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD  
**Deciders**: Chief Architect, Head of AI Engineering, CTO, Platform Product Owner  
**Context Level**: AI System Design, Platform Services, and Scalability

## Context

As multiple teams adopt AI across forecasting, exception triage, summarization, NLP routing, and knowledge retrieval, fragmented development results in:

- Duplicated prompt logic and retriever components  
- Uncoordinated LLM API access and model versioning  
- Cost inefficiencies from isolated fine-tuning and inference flows  
- Inconsistent observability, traceability, and retry behavior

To support scale and governance, AI capabilities must be built as reusable, composable shared servicesâ€”not domain-specific silos.

## Decision

Adopt a **Shared AI Services Strategy**, where common functionality is exposed via modular APIs, SDKs, and orchestration blocks. These include:

- Prompt templates and orchestration flows (e.g., response drafting, classification)  
- Retriever services for domain-specific memory (RAG)  
- Evaluation frameworks, feature extractors, and safety guards  
- Shared observability/logging wrappers for all LLM interactions  
- Model registry and governance tooling for lifecycle control

These services are versioned, documented, and deployed via internal catalogs and developer portals.

## Rationale

- **CIO Alignment**: Increases ROI from AI investments and ensures enterprise-wide consistency  
- **CTO Alignment**: Reduces maintenance cost, model sprawl, and onboarding friction  
- **Chief Architect Alignment**: Enables platform-scale AI architecture, shared tooling, and policy enforcement

## Consequences

### Benefits

- **Modularity**: New workflows can plug into common components without rebuilding core logic  
- **Policy Centralization**: Evaluation, rate-limiting, and cost controls applied uniformly  
- **Faster Delivery**: Developers reuse APIs and SDKs rather than reinventing prompt scaffolds  
- **Quality Assurance**: Prompt and output reuse enables regression testing, scoring, and feedback

### Trade-Offs

- **Initial Design Overhead**: Shared services must be abstract enough to handle varied use cases  
- **Governance Discipline**: Requires ownership, SLAs, and support from platform teams  
- **Version Management**: Must balance stability with evolvability of shared logic

## Alternatives Considered

- **Domain-Centric AI Ownership**  
  Promotes autonomy but leads to duplication, fragmentation, and inconsistent governance.

- **Central LLM API Proxy Only**  
  Helps with rate control but lacks composability, prompt logic reuse, or version-aware interfaces.

## Lifecycle and Governance

- All shared AI services must publish documentation, usage policies, and version histories  
- New requests for domain-specific AI flows must first evaluate fit with shared service offerings  
- Evaluation dashboards must track reuse, coverage, and reliability of shared services  
- Shared services must participate in quarterly platform reviews and cost audits
