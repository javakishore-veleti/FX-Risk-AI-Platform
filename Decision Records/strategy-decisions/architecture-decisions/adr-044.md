# ADR-044: Cost Attribution and Usage Metering for Shared AI Infrastructure

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD  
**Deciders**: Chief Architect, Cloud FinOps Lead, CIO Office  
**Context Level**: Cost Management, Platform Governance, Cross-Team Resource Usage

## Context

As AI infrastructure (e.g., GPUs, vector DBs, shared pipelines) becomes centralized, organizations face challenges in understanding:

- Which team or use case consumes which resources  
- Whether usage is aligned with business value or budgets  
- How to enable cost transparency, showbacks, or chargebacks  
- How to enforce quotas or curb overuse

Without **cost attribution and usage metering**, shared AI infrastructure can become a financial and operational black hole.

## Decision

Implement a **cost attribution and usage metering framework** across the AI platform.

### Key Features:

1. **Tagging and Metadata Enforcement**  
   - All workloads, jobs, and services must be tagged with `team`, `project`, `env`, `owner`  
   - CI/CD and IaC templates enforce tagging policy

2. **Resource Metering**  
   - Collect GPU, CPU, memory, storage, and API usage per tenant/team  
   - Vector store and embedding service calls tracked with latency and size metrics

3. **Billing Dashboards**  
   - Cost and usage dashboards segmented by team, project, and domain  
   - Forecasts and anomaly alerts (e.g., month-end spikes)

4. **Showback / Chargeback Policy**  
   - Monthly reports shared with engineering and finance leads  
   - Optional internal billing or budget offset mechanisms

5. **Quota Configuration and Alerts**  
   - Per-team limits on compute, inference tokens, model usage  
   - Alerting on nearing quota thresholds

## Rationale

- **CIO Alignment**: Enables financial visibility and supports investment decisions  
- **CTO Alignment**: Encourages responsible engineering behavior and cloud hygiene  
- **Chief Architect Alignment**: Promotes scalable, predictable platform evolution

## Consequences

### Benefits

- Transparency and accountability for infrastructure usage  
- Informs ROI discussions and capacity planning  
- Identifies dormant or underutilized resources for optimization  
- Supports internal billing, compliance, and audit reporting

### Trade-Offs

- Requires upfront instrumentation and policy enforcement  
- May generate friction during adoption as teams become usage-aware  
- Needs cultural maturity to treat infrastructure as a shared product

## Alternatives Considered

- Centralized billing with no visibility per team  
  → Leads to misuse, budget overruns, and misaligned expectations.

- Manual tagging or spreadsheet-based tracking  
  → Unsustainable and error-prone at scale.

## Lifecycle and Governance

- Cloud FinOps team governs tagging schema and dashboard templates  
- Platform team integrates metering agents and billing APIs  
- Policy checks embedded in CI/CD and IaC pipelines  
- Reports reviewed monthly with architecture steering committee
