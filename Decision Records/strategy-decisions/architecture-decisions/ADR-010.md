# ADR-010: JSON Schema for All Internal APIs and Events

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD  
**Deciders**: Chief Architect, API Governance Lead, CTO  
**Context Level**: API Design, Event Modeling, and Data Contract Strategy

## Context

As platforms become increasingly event-driven and composed of loosely coupled services, the need for consistent, verifiable, and well-documented data contracts becomes critical. The system architecture includes:

- Internal REST APIs, event streams (Kafka, Kinesis), and background jobs  
- LLM input/output schemas and retriever payloads  
- Downstream consumers that rely on stability across bounded contexts

Without a unified schema strategy, teams risk:

- Contract mismatches and brittle integrations  
- Difficulty onboarding new teams or vendors  
- Poor documentation and lack of change tracking  
- Data lineage gaps that break observability and audit trails

## Decision

Adopt **JSON Schema** as the standard for defining, validating, and documenting:

- All internal REST API request/response bodies  
- All event payloads on internal message buses or streams  
- Structured prompt input/output interfaces where applicable

Schemas will be stored in a version-controlled registry and referenced by all services at runtime and build time (via schema validation).

## Rationale

- **CIO Alignment**: Ensures enterprise-wide consistency, compliance, and data quality across AI and operational systems  
- **CTO Alignment**: Reduces integration risk, accelerates team onboarding, and enforces API hygiene  
- **Chief Architect Alignment**: Enables enforceable boundaries and change management across architectural layers

## Consequences

### Benefits

- **Validation**: Payloads can be validated at runtime, build time, and through CI pipelines  
- **Documentation**: JSON Schema supports auto-generation of OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, and markdown specs  
- **Governance**: Schema changes are explicit, reviewed, and traceable to changelogs and feature flags  
- **Testing**: Enables contract testing and synthetic data generation for integration suites

### Trade-Offs

- **Schema Discipline**: Teams must learn and maintain schema definitions as part of development  
- **Versioning Overhead**: Requires semver or tagging strategy for breaking vs. non-breaking schema changes  
- **Tooling Setup**: Needs validators, linters, and schema compatibility tooling as part of the dev workflow

## Alternatives Considered

- **No Formal Schema Enforcement**  
  Faster development initially, but leads to fragile services and difficult-to-debug failures.

- **Protocol Buffers or Avro**  
  Good for binary efficiency and typed enforcement, but requires a more complex build pipeline and tooling alignment across languages.

## Lifecycle and Governance

- Each API and event contract must declare a schema ID, version, and description  
- Schema registry must be included in the CI/CD pipeline for backward compatibility checks  
- Breaking changes must be reviewed and versioned with consumer communication policies
