# ADR-012: Security and IAM Boundary Patterns for Modular Services

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD  
**Deciders**: Chief Architect, CISO, CTO  
**Context Level**: Enterprise Security Architecture and Modular Platform Governance

## Context

The platform is designed as a composition of modular services—data pipelines, AI orchestration, forecasting engines, APIs, and observability tooling—each independently deployed and scaled. As services span multiple teams and business units, the following challenges arise:

- Unclear ownership and responsibility for data access  
- Over-permissive roles and shared credentials across modules  
- Lack of audit boundaries for high-privilege operations  
- Difficulty enforcing least privilege and policy-as-code standards

IAM misconfigurations are one of the leading causes of data breaches and compliance violations in cloud-native systems.

## Decision

Establish a **service-oriented IAM boundary strategy** where:

- Each service module operates under a dedicated IAM role  
- Roles are scoped with least-privilege permissions, aligned to domain-specific access patterns  
- All cross-service access (e.g., one Lambda reading from a forecast S3 bucket) must be explicitly defined via resource-based policies or service role assumptions  
- Identity boundaries are treated as security perimeters, not just logical separations

## Rationale

- **CIO Alignment**: Supports compliance mandates (e.g., SOC 2, ISO 27001) and fine-grained audit controls  
- **CTO Alignment**: Enables safer delegation of development and deployment without introducing systemic risk  
- **Chief Architect Alignment**: Aligns identity with modular architecture, promotes secure-by-default composition, and enables IAM policy automation

## Consequences

### Benefits

- **Blast Radius Reduction**: Compromised service limits impact to its own IAM boundary  
- **Policy Transparency**: All permissions are declared and reviewed in code (e.g., via AWS CDK or Terraform)  
- **Auditability**: Each action is logged with a service role, enabling traceability and anomaly detection  
- **DevOps Enablement**: Teams can work in parallel without elevated, shared access

### Trade-Offs

- **Initial Overhead**: IAM roles, trust relationships, and policy boundaries need to be defined upfront  
- **Operational Complexity**: More granular access requires tighter configuration and testing  
- **Cross-Service Friction**: Requires explicit design of inter-service contracts and access needs

## Alternatives Considered

- **Flat IAM Strategy (Shared Role Across Services)**  
  Easier to manage but creates significant security and compliance risks.

- **Fully Managed Identities via External IAM Providers**  
  May improve visibility, but integration overhead and AWS-native compatibility become concerns.

## Lifecycle and Governance

- Each service must have a named IAM role, tagged with team, business domain, and environment  
- Roles must be versioned and deployed via IaC (e.g., AWS CDK, Terraform)  
- All roles must be reviewed periodically for permission sprawl and unused access  
- Cross-role assumptions must be justified and documented per architectural review
