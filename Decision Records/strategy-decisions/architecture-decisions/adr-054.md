# ADR-054: Automated Compliance Tagging for AI Artifacts

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD  
**Deciders**: Chief Architect, Data Governance Lead, Platform Security Officer  
**Context Level**: AI Compliance, Data Classification, Model Lifecycle Management

## Context

AI systems and their components (prompts, models, context data, vector stores) often carry varying compliance implications:

- Some models are restricted to internal-only use (e.g., trained on sensitive data)  
- Certain embeddings may include financial, health, or legal context  
- Output of some prompts may fall under retention or audit rules  
- Artifacts may cross borders or be subject to export restrictions

Manual tagging of such artifacts is inconsistent and unscalable. A **compliance tagging mechanism** is required to automate classification and enforce downstream policy controls.

## Decision

Implement an **Automated Compliance Tagging System** for all critical AI artifacts across the platform lifecycle.

### Scope of Tagging:

1. **Models**  
   - Trained on sensitive, regulated, or licensed data → tagged `internal`, `restricted`, or `open`  
   - Includes training metadata (datasets, purpose, creator, version)

2. **Prompts**  
   - Tagged based on data classification of inputs/outputs and function (e.g., `customer-facing`, `regulated`, `auditable`)  
   - Static analysis and risk scoring applied at commit time

3. **Context Stores / Embeddings**  
   - Associated with data domains (e.g., `PHI`, `Financial`, `Legal`)  
   - Tags used to restrict prompt access or output usage

4. **Inference Pipelines and APIs**  
   - Endpoints tagged with risk profile and compliance enforcement flags  
   - Enables route-based or tenant-based restrictions

### Tag Format and Management

- Tags follow an extensible schema:  
  `{"artifact_type": "prompt", "sensitivity": "internal", "compliance": ["GDPR", "SOX"]}`  
- Managed via metadata service or artifact registry

## Rationale

- **CIO Alignment**: Ensures proactive compliance and audit readiness  
- **CTO Alignment**: Enables policy-as-code and runtime safeguards  
- **Chief Architect Alignment**: Standardizes lifecycle metadata for modularity and trust

## Consequences

### Benefits

- Supports zero-trust design and runtime access controls  
- Enables lineage tracking across AI pipeline components  
- Flags non-compliant use of restricted prompts or models  
- Automates regulatory documentation and audit mapping

### Trade-Offs

- Requires consistent tagging policies and developer education  
- May cause friction if tags block previously allowed behavior  
- Must evolve tagging schema as regulations or systems change

## Alternatives Considered

- Manual spreadsheet or developer-level tagging  
  → Incomplete and error-prone; hard to scale.

- Tagging only models, not prompts or pipelines  
  → Ignores risk surfaces in orchestration and end-user exposure.

## Lifecycle and Governance

- Data governance team defines baseline tags and enforcement policies  
- Artifact registries (e.g., MLflow, PromptHub) store and expose tag metadata  
- Tag violations blocked at CI/CD or flagged in deployment dashboards  
- Reviewed quarterly with security and legal compliance teams
