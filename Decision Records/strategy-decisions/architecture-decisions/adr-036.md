# ADR-036: Semantic Layer for AI-Informed Business Metrics

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD  
**Deciders**: Chief Architect, Head of Data Products, BI Platform Lead  
**Context Level**: Data & Analytics Architecture, Decision Intelligence Enablement

## Context

As AI models influence more business decisions—such as risk scoring, SLA forecasting, and prioritization—there is a growing need to:

- Present these outcomes in dashboards used by business teams  
- Align AI outputs with operational KPIs and user-interpretable metrics  
- Avoid duplication of metric definitions across teams and dashboards  
- Enable consistency, reuse, and trust in AI-informed insights

Traditional dashboards are often hard-coded with logic in SQL, BI tools, or scripts, causing inconsistent metric interpretations across teams.

## Decision

Introduce a **Semantic Layer for AI-Informed Business Metrics** that acts as a governed translation layer between raw data/AI predictions and business consumption tools.

1. **Use a Semantic Modeling Tool**  
   - Examples: dbt metrics layer, LookML (Looker), Cube.js, or Apache Superset semantic config  
   - Define KPIs, dimensions, filters, and derived fields in code with version control

2. **Register AI Outputs as First-Class Fields**  
   - Metrics include model-inferred outputs like `risk_score`, `forecasted_resolution_time`, `expected_volume`, etc.  
   - Descriptions include lineage to model version and feature store

3. **Governed Metric Dictionary**  
   - Metrics reviewed and approved by data product owners and business analysts  
   - Metric catalog accessible via internal portal with tagging and search

4. **CI/CD and Testing**  
   - Validate metric definitions through unit and regression tests  
   - Changes trigger documentation updates and notify downstream teams

## Rationale

- **CIO Alignment**: Enables self-service, trustable data access for cross-functional stakeholders  
- **CTO Alignment**: Provides consistency and reusability across reporting and alerting surfaces  
- **Chief Architect Alignment**: Establishes AI output as structured, governed, and reusable in business logic

## Consequences

### Benefits

- Reduces metric duplication and drift  
- Facilitates cross-team analytics alignment (e.g., same risk score in UI, dashboard, and reports)  
- Boosts data literacy by centralizing KPI definitions  
- Simplifies onboarding and documentation

### Trade-Offs

- Requires initial modeling effort and alignment between data and business teams  
- Metrics layer may add slight complexity to development workflows  
- Success depends on adoption and data governance participation

## Alternatives Considered

- Embed logic directly in dashboards or SQL views  
  → Hard to version, prone to duplication, opaque to business users.

- Create isolated APIs for each metric  
  → Not scalable and lacks discoverability.

## Lifecycle and Governance

- Data product owners define and own metrics in semantic layer  
- Metrics documented and discoverable in a shared glossary  
- Platform team enforces tests and reviews via pull requests  
- All production dashboards must source metrics from approved layer
