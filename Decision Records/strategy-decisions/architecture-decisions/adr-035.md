# ADR-035: Exception Logging and Traceability in AI Pipelines

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD  
**Deciders**: Chief Architect, ML Ops Lead, Observability Lead  
**Context Level**: AI Workflow Debuggability and Auditability

## Context

AI pipelines often include complex data transformations, feature engineering, model inference, and post-processing steps. When errors occur (e.g., malformed data, model failures, service timeouts), debugging becomes difficult due to:

- Poorly structured or inconsistent logging  
- Missing correlation with input records or downstream outputs  
- Unclear propagation of exception metadata across pipeline stages  
- Lack of audit trails for model decisions and AI-assisted outputs

This is exacerbated in batch workflows, asynchronous orchestration (e.g., Step Functions, Airflow), and multi-tenant environments.

## Decision

Standardize **Exception Logging and Traceability** across AI pipelines using the following strategy:

1. **Structured Exception Logs**  
   - Use structured formats (e.g., JSON) with keys: `trace_id`, `pipeline_stage`, `error_type`, `input_sample_id`, `timestamp`, `severity`, `exception_message`, `stack_trace`

2. **Trace ID Propagation**  
   - Every pipeline run is assigned a unique `trace_id` that is attached to all logs, metrics, and outputs

3. **Contextual Metadata**  
   - Logs include contextual fields like model version, feature config hash, dataset ID, execution environment

4. **Log Aggregation and Retention**  
   - Send logs to central log index (e.g., OpenSearch, Azure Monitor, Stackdriver)  
   - Retain logs per policy based on pipeline criticality and data classification

5. **Error Classification**  
   - Standard taxonomy for errors: `validation_error`, `model_runtime_error`, `data_drift`, `infra_error`, etc.

## Rationale

- **CIO Alignment**: Enables full explainability and accountability of AI outcomes  
- **CTO Alignment**: Reduces time-to-debug and boosts confidence in platform reliability  
- **Chief Architect Alignment**: Establishes AI as a robust, governable capability

## Consequences

### Benefits

- Enables forensic debugging across multi-stage ML workflows  
- Aligns with regulatory expectations around explainable AI and auditable logs  
- Reduces MTTR (mean time to resolution) and improves observability  
- Allows automated alerting and classification of pipeline issues

### Trade-Offs

- Requires structured logging discipline across diverse tooling and languages  
- Slight performance overhead for deep error capture and trace tagging  
- Retention and search costs increase with volume

## Alternatives Considered

- Ad hoc error messages per team or tool  
  → Difficult to correlate or analyze at platform level.

- Exception silencing in batch jobs  
  → Leads to silent failures and downstream data quality issues.

## Lifecycle and Governance

- Logging schema defined and enforced by Observability Team  
- Pipeline libraries and wrappers auto-include trace context  
- CI/CD checks validate error handler inclusion  
- Dashboards track error types, frequency, and unresolved traces
