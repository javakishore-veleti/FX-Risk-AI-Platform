# ADR-022: Common Application Framework (CAF) Enforcement Pattern

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD  
**Deciders**: Chief Architect, CTO, Platform Engineering Lead  
**Context Level**: Application Architecture and Developer Enablement

## Context

As enterprise platforms scale across multiple teams and services, inconsistencies in application scaffolding, security configuration, and observability patterns emerge. This results in:

- Duplicate effort in setting up service boilerplate (logging, health checks, tracing, etc.)  
- Inconsistent adherence to architecture, security, and compliance standards  
- Fragmented DX (developer experience) and onboarding workflows  
- Challenges in achieving traceability, version alignment, and governance

A Common Application Framework (CAF) serves as a reusable and opinionated scaffold for building services that comply with platform architecture guidelines out of the box.

## Decision

Establish and enforce a **Common Application Framework (CAF)** pattern that provides:

- Bootstrap project templates in supported languages (e.g., Python, Node.js, Java)  
- Built-in wiring for telemetry, observability, tracing, and IAM token validation  
- Plugin-based modules for service-specific extensions (e.g., AI orchestration, Kafka consumers, webhooks)  
- Scaffolded README, ADR stubs, test harnesses, and config templates  
- Pre-commit hooks and CI policies to ensure base compliance from day one

The CAF will be published via internal registries or Git templates, with regular versioning and backward compatibility policies.

## Rationale

- **CIO Alignment**: Drives compliance and delivery consistency across business-critical applications  
- **CTO Alignment**: Reduces tech debt, improves dev velocity, and encourages standardization  
- **Chief Architect Alignment**: Guarantees adherence to architectural principles and promotes modular reuse

## Consequences

### Benefits

- **Consistency**: Uniform service behavior across APIs, logging, tracing, and deployment flows  
- **Faster Onboarding**: Developers can start from secure, observable, pre-approved patterns  
- **Governance**: Ensures that all services include key architectural hooks and metadata  
- **Evolution**: Framework versions enable progressive enhancements and backward-safe migrations

### Trade-Offs

- **Adoption Ramp**: Teams may need training or migration support to onboard to CAF  
- **Flexibility Limitations**: Custom use cases may require CAF extensions or overrides  
- **Maintenance Overhead**: CAF must be updated with changes in policies, dependencies, and toolchains

## Alternatives Considered

- **Guidance Docs + Linter Rules**  
  Helpful, but passive â€” does not enforce structure or ensure consistent implementations.

- **Service-Specific Frameworks (No Shared Layer)**  
  Results in drift, redundant scaffolding, and inconsistent compliance posture.

## Lifecycle and Governance

- CAF versions must be maintained with changelogs, breaking change notices, and upgrade guides  
- A platform architecture board will review proposals for CAF enhancement or exceptions  
- Tooling (e.g., CI/CD templates, linter plugins) must enforce key CAF policies on every merge  
- Developer feedback loops will guide continuous improvement of the CAF experience
