# ADR-053: Distributed Evaluation Harness for LLM Testing at Scale

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD  
**Deciders**: Chief Architect, AI Quality Assurance Lead, Platform SRE Lead  
**Context Level**: Model Evaluation, Testing Infrastructure, AI Platform Reliability

## Context

As the number of LLM-powered applications and variations grows (across models, prompts, context sources), testing them in isolation or small batches becomes inefficient. Issues that arise include:

- Evaluation lag when new prompts or models are deployed  
- Difficulty validating prompt upgrades or prompt chaining logic  
- Scalability limits for regression testing or red-teaming  
- Lack of CI integration to block poor-performing configurations

To ensure production-readiness and scalability, a **distributed testing framework** is essential.

## Decision

Adopt a **Distributed Evaluation Harness** that executes and benchmarks prompt–model–context combinations at scale.

### Core Capabilities:

1. **Test Scenario Definition**  
   - Declarative YAML or JSON files for test inputs:  
     - Prompt variant  
     - Context set  
     - Target model  
     - Expected output constraints (keywords, structure, sentiment)

2. **Parallel Execution Engine**  
   - Distributed orchestration via Ray, Dask, or serverless compute  
   - Scalable across hundreds of test cases per run

3. **Metric Capture and Scoring**  
   - Automatic computation of LLM-specific metrics:  
     - Factuality, relevance, tone, toxicity, fluency  
   - Rule-based and embedding-based output comparison

4. **Failure Classification and Logging**  
   - Failed test cases stored with context, prompt, model ID, and error class  
   - Dashboard for triage and review

5. **CI/CD Integration and Release Gating**  
   - Evaluation runs executed before deployment of model, prompt, or feature  
   - Block deployments with critical failures or coverage gaps

## Rationale

- **CIO Alignment**: Ensures governance and public risk avoidance  
- **CTO Alignment**: Supports safe, fast delivery pipelines for AI features  
- **Chief Architect Alignment**: Reinforces architecture-wide quality enforcement

## Consequences

### Benefits

- Catch regressions and hallucinations before they impact users  
- Empowers red-teaming and scenario simulations at scale  
- Ensures consistent quality across teams and domains  
- Enables prompt as code and testable LLM configurations

### Trade-Offs

- Requires upfront investment in test data and scenario templates  
- Ongoing governance needed to avoid stale or low-quality tests  
- Needs team discipline to tag and maintain prompt/model versions

## Alternatives Considered

- Manual testing or analyst QA  
  → Not scalable; too slow for CI/CD and modern workflows.

- Small batch offline regression scripts  
  → Cannot simulate full variability of inputs or downstream effects.

## Lifecycle and Governance

- Owned by QA team in partnership with AI platform group  
- Test scenarios reviewed biweekly for coverage gaps  
- Evaluation failures linked to JIRA tickets with explainability metadata  
- Results shared in LLM deployment readiness reviews
