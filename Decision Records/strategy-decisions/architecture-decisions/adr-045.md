# ADR-045: ML-Powered Anomaly Detection for Platform Reliability

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD  
**Deciders**: Chief Architect, Observability Lead, SRE Manager  
**Context Level**: Reliability Engineering, Platform Monitoring, AI for Ops (AIOps)

## Context

Traditional threshold-based monitoring is often insufficient for complex AI and data platforms. Symptoms of system degradation — such as intermittent latency, usage spikes, model drift, or data staleness — may go unnoticed until they trigger business-impacting incidents.

Moreover, human-defined thresholds do not adapt to evolving workloads or seasonal patterns.

Anomaly detection using machine learning can proactively identify issues before they become outages.

## Decision

Implement an **ML-Powered Anomaly Detection System** for platform reliability monitoring across data pipelines, model services, and shared infrastructure.

### Core Components:

1. **Signal Selection**  
   - Monitor: pipeline throughput, error rates, latency, data freshness, GPU usage, API call volumes, inference response patterns

2. **ML Algorithms**  
   - Use time-series models (e.g., Prophet, Holt-Winters, Isolation Forests, Amazon Lookout for Metrics)  
   - Auto-adapt to seasonality, trend shifts, and new services

3. **Anomaly Scoring and Alerts**  
   - Assign severity scores to anomalies and route to appropriate on-call or Slack channels  
   - Include “explanation” field (e.g., deviation from rolling mean, sudden spike)

4. **Feedback and Tuning Loop**  
   - SREs label false positives/negatives to improve model precision  
   - Thresholds and features refined via CI retraining pipelines

5. **Correlation with Incidents**  
   - Link anomaly patterns with past incident logs for root cause analysis  
   - Alert suppression rules applied based on change windows or known downtimes

## Rationale

- **CIO Alignment**: Increases uptime for business-critical AI functions  
- **CTO Alignment**: Reduces mean time to detect (MTTD) and resolve (MTTR) failures  
- **Chief Architect Alignment**: Embeds intelligence into observability stack, improving platform maturity

## Consequences

### Benefits

- Early detection of service degradation or misbehavior  
- Reduces unplanned downtime and service disruption  
- Enhances signal-to-noise ratio in alerting systems  
- Supports compliance by ensuring SLAs are met consistently

### Trade-Offs

- Initial complexity in setting up models and baselines  
- Requires monitoring hygiene and observability coverage  
- False positives may reduce trust without tuning and feedback

## Alternatives Considered

- Static threshold-based alerts only  
  → Inflexible, brittle under changing conditions, and hard to maintain.

- Manual dashboard watching  
  → Not scalable or proactive for real-time operations.

## Lifecycle and Governance

- Owned by SRE team in collaboration with AI Observability group  
- New metrics onboarded quarterly into anomaly system  
- Alerting behavior reviewed weekly during ops syncs  
- Postmortems tagged with anomaly scores for feedback loop
