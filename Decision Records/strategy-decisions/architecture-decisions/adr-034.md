# ADR-034: Domain-Driven Repository Ownership and Boundaries

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD  
**Deciders**: Chief Architect, Domain Leads, Platform Engineering  
**Context Level**: Source Code Management, Platform Modularity, Ownership

## Context

As engineering organizations scale and platforms evolve to support multiple AI, data, orchestration, and integration domains, monolithic repositories or poorly delineated codebases result in:

- Coupled deployments across unrelated teams  
- Ownership confusion and friction  
- Inconsistent coding and testing standards  
- Increased merge conflicts, hard-to-track regressions

To ensure modularity, clear responsibility, and alignment with business domains, the codebase architecture must align with the system’s **domain boundaries**.

## Decision

Adopt a **Domain-Driven Repository Strategy** as follows:

1. **One Repo per Major Domain**  
   - Each repo corresponds to a bounded context (e.g., `forecasting`, `orchestration-api`, `insights-engine`, `validation-suite`)

2. **Named with Intent**  
   - Repos follow naming pattern: `platform-{domain}` or `{org}-{function}`  
   - E.g., `fx-risk-ai-forecasting-pipeline`, `fx-risk-ai-shared-libs`

3. **Well-Defined Ownership**  
   - Every repo has a `CODEOWNERS` file or similar  
   - Read/write permissions mapped to teams, not individuals

4. **Cross-Repo Reuse via Shared Libraries**  
   - Shared data models, validators, and utilities extracted into versioned modules  
   - Avoid circular dependencies or tight coupling

5. **Enforced Boundaries**  
   - No intra-repo calls that violate domain boundaries  
   - Use API contracts (REST/GraphQL/gRPC) or message queues for interop

## Rationale

- **CIO Alignment**: Reflects business value streams and funding units  
- **CTO Alignment**: Enables independent delivery and velocity tracking by domain  
- **Chief Architect Alignment**: Encourages separation of concerns and scalability in platform evolution

## Consequences

### Benefits

- Clear boundaries for ownership, releases, and accountability  
- Teams can move at different speeds without merge/deploy entanglement  
- Easier to manage secrets, environment variables, and CI policies  
- Architecture and governance easier to document and enforce

### Trade-Offs

- Increases the number of repos to track, review, and provision  
- Requires CI/CD templating to avoid redundant setup  
- Shared logic must be maintained in libraries, requiring version control discipline

## Alternatives Considered

- Monorepo with internal folders for each domain  
  → Works initially but becomes hard to enforce boundaries and decouple release cadences.

- Freeform repo layout  
  → Often results in tight coupling, undocumented interdependencies, and security drift.

## Lifecycle and Governance

- Repo creation requires architecture review and domain alignment  
- Dependencies between repos tracked via changelogs and version pinning  
- Shared libraries reviewed quarterly for usage and refactoring  
- Documentation generated per repo and linked in central platform README
