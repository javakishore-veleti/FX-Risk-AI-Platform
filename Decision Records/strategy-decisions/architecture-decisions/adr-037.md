# ADR-037: Feature Store Integration for Reusable AI Features

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD  
**Deciders**: Chief Architect, ML Platform Lead, Data Engineering Lead  
**Context Level**: AI Infrastructure, Model Consistency, Data Reuse

## Context

As ML and AI adoption grows across multiple use cases, the challenge of maintaining **feature consistency**, **reusability**, and **lineage tracking** becomes critical. Issues commonly faced include:

- Training-serving skew due to ad hoc feature generation  
- Duplication of feature engineering logic across pipelines and teams  
- Lack of versioning or explainability of derived features  
- Inefficient data access patterns and inconsistent model performance

A **Feature Store** can address these challenges by managing the lifecycle of features, from ingestion to online/offline serving.

## Decision

Integrate a centralized **Feature Store** into the AI development stack to serve as a system of record for shared, production-grade ML features.

### Key Capabilities:

1. **Feature Registration**  
   - Teams publish features with metadata: description, owner, freshness, transformation logic, tags

2. **Online and Offline Access**  
   - Offline: used during training with batch read support (e.g., Parquet, Hive, Redshift)  
   - Online: low-latency lookup APIs for real-time inference (e.g., Redis, DynamoDB)

3. **Versioning and Lineage**  
   - All feature changes tracked with version identifiers and changelogs  
   - Feature-to-model lineage viewable via catalog or dashboard

4. **Monitoring and TTLs**  
   - Feature freshness monitored and TTL alerts configured  
   - Expired or stale features flagged before inference

5. **Integration with Model Pipelines**  
   - Features consumed via SDKs or APIs in training and deployment  
   - Backfills supported for retroactive data joins

## Rationale

- **CIO Alignment**: Boosts explainability and trust in AI decisions  
- **CTO Alignment**: Prevents engineering duplication and accelerates delivery  
- **Chief Architect Alignment**: Establishes reusable, traceable infrastructure components for AI

## Consequences

### Benefits

- Consistent feature logic across training and inference  
- Faster onboarding for new use cases via reusable features  
- Reduces data quality issues and governance blind spots  
- Enables observability of model performance at feature level

### Trade-Offs

- Initial setup complexity and need for governance practices  
- Requires training for teams unfamiliar with feature stores  
- Storage and serving infra may require scaling over time

## Alternatives Considered

- Embedding feature logic directly in notebooks or pipelines  
  → Causes inconsistencies, duplication, and is hard to audit.

- Centralized feature catalog without serving support  
  → Helps documentation, but not real-time inference or lineage.

## Lifecycle and Governance

- Platform ML team owns infrastructure, versioning policy, and uptime  
- Feature owners define logic and validate via peer reviews  
- CI pipelines test backward compatibility of features used in production  
- Feature usage metrics analyzed to deprecate unused logic
