# ADR-023: Interservice Communication Strategy (API + Event + Async Contracts)

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD  
**Deciders**: Chief Architect, Platform Integration Lead, Lead Engineers  
**Context Level**: System Design and Service Mesh Architecture

## Context

Modern platforms are composed of modular services deployed across domains, layers, and clouds. These services need to exchange information efficiently and reliably, yet variations in use cases require different communication styles:

- **Synchronous API calls** for real-time operations (e.g., data validation, task coordination)  
- **Asynchronous messaging** for loose coupling and resilience (e.g., events, job queues)  
- **Data contracts** to ensure schema evolution without breaking dependencies

Without a unified communication strategy, the platform risks:

- Tight coupling between services  
- Inconsistent SLAs and timeout behaviors  
- Contract drift and version mismatch  
- Reduced visibility into interservice dependencies

## Decision

Adopt a **hybrid interservice communication strategy** that includes:

1. **Synchronous REST/gRPC APIs** for latency-sensitive flows  
2. **Event-based asynchronous communication** using Kafka, SNS/SQS, or Azure Event Hubs  
3. **Non-API contracts** via JSON Schema, AsyncAPI, or Avro definitions  
4. **Interface versioning** and semantic contract evolution (e.g., additive changes only in v1)  
5. **Service Discovery & Health** via cloud-native service registries or mesh sidecars

Each communication pathway will be documented and governed via shared registries and monitored using distributed tracing.

## Rationale

- **CIO Alignment**: Enables flexible business workflows while minimizing risk from system coupling  
- **CTO Alignment**: Optimizes cost and latency trade-offs between real-time and eventual consistency  
- **Chief Architect Alignment**: Reinforces modularity, schema evolution hygiene, and long-term scalability

## Consequences

### Benefits

- **Resilience**: Async events and retries decouple service uptime from availability of all dependencies  
- **Scalability**: Event-driven patterns support scale-out without bottlenecking critical APIs  
- **Governance**: Schemas and versioning support backwards-compatible changes and auditability  
- **Observability**: Service-to-service flows can be traced, monitored, and inspected

### Trade-Offs

- **Complexity**: Hybrid communication patterns may require additional tooling and conventions  
- **Skill Gaps**: Teams unfamiliar with event contracts or schema governance need enablement  
- **Policy Drift**: Without enforcement, services may misuse sync calls or over-publish events

## Alternatives Considered

- **Synchronous API-Only Strategy**  
  Simple but fragile â€” not resilient under load spikes or partial failures.

- **Event-Only Pub/Sub Model**  
  Good for eventual consistency but inadequate for transactional coordination or real-time flows.

## Lifecycle and Governance

- A contract registry (OpenAPI, AsyncAPI) will track schemas, versions, and consumer metadata  
- Contract breaking changes require proposal, simulation, and review  
- Cross-team interfaces will be reviewed quarterly in architecture working groups  
- Monitoring will include interservice SLAs, retry rates, and latency metrics
