# ADR-026: Cloud Security Boundary Enforcement Using SCP + VPC + IAM

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD  
**Deciders**: Chief Architect, CISO, Cloud Security Lead  
**Context Level**: Cloud Security Architecture and Access Control Strategy

## Context

Multi-tenant and multi-team cloud platforms face increasing challenges in enforcing consistent security boundaries across cloud services, environments (dev, staging, prod), and organizational units. Threats include:

- Lateral movement across services due to overly permissive IAM  
- Shadow IT risks from direct cloud service access  
- Untracked internet exposure from misconfigured endpoints  
- Regulatory compliance violations due to data egress or region leakage

To maintain defense-in-depth, governance, and least-privilege, cloud access boundaries must be enforced using multiple layers of control.

## Decision

Implement a **multi-layered security boundary enforcement model** comprising:

1. **Service Control Policies (SCPs)** — restrict allowed services, regions, and actions at org/account level  
2. **VPC-based Network Segmentation** — isolate workloads by domain, sensitivity, and access tier  
3. **Fine-Grained IAM Policies** — enforce least privilege per service, user, and automation identity  
4. **Data Perimeter Controls** — apply S3/KMS/EBS restrictions, VPC endpoints, and DNS firewalls  
5. **Logging and Monitoring** — mandate CloudTrail, Config Rules, IAM Access Analyzer, GuardDuty

These policies are codified and versioned through Infrastructure-as-Code (e.g., Terraform modules) and tied to deployment gates in CI/CD pipelines.

## Rationale

- **CIO Alignment**: Reduces regulatory risk, ensures auditability, and supports zero-trust mandates  
- **CTO Alignment**: Enables secure innovation by building trust zones and reducing blast radius  
- **Chief Architect Alignment**: Encodes security boundaries into platform foundation, not ad hoc team logic

## Consequences

### Benefits

- **Defense-in-Depth**: Multiple control planes reduce reliance on any single gatekeeping layer  
- **Environment Isolation**: Dev/test/prod boundaries enforced by network and policy  
- **Audit Readiness**: Activity logs, SCPs, IAM role assumptions are all verifiable  
- **Preventive Controls**: SCPs block policy violations before execution—not just alert afterward

### Trade-Offs

- **Complex Setup**: Requires upfront investment in IaC modules, Org hierarchy, and policy testing  
- **Governance Rigor**: Onboarding new services or exceptions needs structured review  
- **Developer Friction**: Improperly scoped IAM roles may block deployment or break functionality

## Alternatives Considered

- **Tag-Based Policy Enforcement Only**  
  Helpful for visibility but insufficient for true access prevention or runtime controls.

- **IAM-Only Enforcement Without SCPs**  
  Risky — individual team policies may unintentionally escalate access or bypass intended boundaries.

## Lifecycle and Governance

- Security policies reviewed quarterly with audit and platform stakeholders  
- Changes to SCPs or VPC policies require security design reviews  
- IAM permission boundaries must be applied to automation identities and service roles  
- Guardrails tested in non-prod environments before promoting to org-wide adoption
