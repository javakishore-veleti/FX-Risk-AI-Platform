# ADR-033: Environment Strategy for Multi-Stage Deployment Pipelines

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD  
**Deciders**: Chief Architect, DevOps Lead, Cloud Infrastructure Governance  
**Context Level**: CI/CD Architecture, Platform Delivery Strategy

## Context

Cloud-native applications and AI pipelines require robust deployment strategies that separate development from production to support:

- Continuous integration and testing  
- Controlled, staged rollouts  
- Auditability and rollback safety  
- Environment-specific configurations (e.g., dataset sources, IAM roles, cost controls)

Many organizations conflate these environments or rely on ad hoc practices, increasing risk of production incidents, configuration drift, and poor visibility into test coverage or compliance alignment.

## Decision

Establish a **Multi-Stage Environment Strategy** consisting of the following standard environments:

1. **Development (`dev`)**  
   - Fast iteration, full engineer access, mocks permitted  
   - Supports hot reload, frequent merges, preview environments

2. **Testing (`test` or `qa`)**  
   - Automated regression testing, security scanning, and model validation  
   - Restricted access to staging data or synthetic test payloads

3. **Staging (`stage`)**  
   - Production-like configuration, same infra topology, same IAM boundaries  
   - Final validation, performance testing, shadow traffic enabled

4. **Production (`prod`)**  
   - Locked down, least-privilege IAM, 24/7 monitoring, strict alerting  
   - Immutable deployments only via pipeline

Each environment uses separate cloud accounts or projects and distinct resource namespaces. Changes promote forward only (dev → test → stage → prod), enforced via GitOps or pipeline policies.

## Rationale

- **CIO Alignment**: Ensures regulatory and change control alignment per environment  
- **CTO Alignment**: Allows high throughput in dev without compromising production  
- **Chief Architect Alignment**: Enables clean separation of duties, config management, and audit trails

## Consequences

### Benefits

- Clear separation of lifecycle and risk boundaries  
- Safer deployment of AI models, infrastructure, and policies  
- Ability to run performance and compliance gates in realistic conditions  
- Each team gains visibility and ownership at the appropriate lifecycle stage

### Trade-Offs

- Slight increase in cloud spend for maintaining 3+ environments  
- Requires configuration management practices to avoid duplication  
- Teams must understand promotion and rollback mechanics

## Alternatives Considered

- Single shared environment with feature flags  
  → Simplifies infra, but increases risk of drift and accidental exposure.

- Separate environments with manual promotion  
  → Error-prone, lacks audit trail, and hard to scale.

## Lifecycle and Governance

- Environment lifecycle managed by Platform Engineering  
- Promotion to `prod` requires passing automated tests and approval gates  
- Staging and test telemetry analyzed to preempt issues  
- Monthly drift detection reports to validate infra/config parity
