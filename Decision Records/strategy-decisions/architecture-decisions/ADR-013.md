# ADR-013: Automated Policy-as-Code for Security and Compliance

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD  
**Deciders**: Chief Architect, CISO, DevSecOps Lead, CTO  
**Context Level**: Enterprise Security, Compliance Automation, and Governance-as-Code

## Context

As the platform evolves and scales across multiple AWS accounts, development teams, and services, manual security policy reviews, checklist-based audits, and fragmented governance become:

- Error-prone and reactive  
- Inadequate for evolving compliance mandates (e.g., SOC 2, HIPAA, GDPR)  
- Difficult to embed into CI/CD and DevOps pipelines  
- Opaque for stakeholders needing traceability and enforcement confidence

To reduce security drift and improve audit readiness, policy enforcement must shift left into code â€” reviewed, versioned, and continuously evaluated.

## Decision

Adopt a **Policy-as-Code (PaC)** strategy using tools like **Open Policy Agent (OPA)**, **AWS Service Control Policies (SCPs)**, **Terraform Sentinel**, and **CloudFormation Guard** to automate enforcement of:

- IAM boundaries and privilege escalation checks  
- Resource tagging standards and encryption-at-rest policies  
- Network boundary compliance (e.g., no open ports, required VPC flows)  
- Logging, monitoring, and trace configuration requirements

Policies will be written as declarative rules and integrated with CI pipelines, pre-deployment checks, and periodic runtime audits.

## Rationale

- **CIO Alignment**: Enables provable controls for internal and external compliance, improves audit turnaround  
- **CTO Alignment**: Reduces reliance on manual reviews, enforces uniform platform standards  
- **Chief Architect Alignment**: Integrates governance into the system design lifecycle, supports security-by-design principles

## Consequences

### Benefits

- **Consistent Enforcement**: Policies are applied the same way across teams, tools, and cloud resources  
- **Version Control and Review**: Policies evolve through Git workflows, PR review, and audit history  
- **CI/CD Integration**: Deployment pipelines fail fast if policy violations are detected  
- **Regulatory Mapping**: Each policy can be annotated with control IDs (e.g., SOC 2 CC6.1, ISO A.9)

### Trade-Offs

- **Learning Curve**: Teams must learn the DSLs and frameworks for policy authoring  
- **False Positives**: Overly aggressive policies can block legitimate infrastructure changes  
- **Operational Tuning**: Requires alert tuning, dry-run modes, and testing for policy effectiveness

## Alternatives Considered

- **Manual Governance Checklists**  
  Inconsistent, non-repeatable, and unscalable for cloud-native architectures.

- **Post-hoc Scanning (e.g., AWS Config only)**  
  Useful for detection but not prevention; lacks fail-fast enforcement.

## Lifecycle and Governance

- All PaC rules must be stored in a centralized, versioned repo with access controls  
- Policy reviews must be tied to architecture or platform changes (e.g., new service onboarding)  
- Violations must trigger CI warnings, and high-risk categories must block deployments  
- A PaC dashboard must track coverage, exceptions, and policy lifecycle
