# ADR-048: External LLM API Usage Policies and Audit Controls

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD  
**Deciders**: Chief Architect, CIO Office, Security Governance Team  
**Context Level**: Enterprise Risk, AI Strategy, Vendor Integration

## Context

Organizations increasingly rely on third-party LLM APIs (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere) for advanced language capabilities. While powerful, these APIs introduce several risks:

- Sensitive data exposure to external inference engines  
- Undocumented usage patterns and cost spikes  
- Lack of internal visibility into prompt/response exchanges  
- No guarantees around model versioning or availability

To ensure responsible usage, external LLM integration must follow strict **policy and observability controls**.

## Decision

Establish a clear **Usage Policy and Audit Control Framework** for external LLM API consumption.

### Policy Components:

1. **Approved Provider List**  
   - Maintain list of approved vendors and supported use cases  
   - Evaluate terms, retention policies, and region-specific restrictions

2. **Proxy Architecture Enforcement**  
   - All requests to external LLMs routed through a secured internal gateway  
   - Enables logging, redaction, rate limiting, and key management

3. **Data Classification Controls**  
   - PII, PHI, trade secrets must be tokenized or excluded via schema policies  
   - Denylist certain fields or objects from leaving organizational boundaries

4. **Prompt and Response Logging**  
   - All prompt-response pairs logged with metadata (timestamp, service, team)  
   - Secure retention for auditability and red-teaming

5. **Cost Quotas and Alerting**  
   - Per-team usage tracked against monthly budgets  
   - Alerting on burst usage or drift from expected behavior

## Rationale

- **CIO Alignment**: Protects data sovereignty, audit readiness, and cost governance  
- **CTO Alignment**: Ensures scalable and secure API usage without blocking innovation  
- **Chief Architect Alignment**: Formalizes vendor integration into platform security posture

## Consequences

### Benefits

- Reduced risk of data leakage through prompt payloads  
- Enables cost-aware, observable usage of external LLM services  
- Maintains compliance with regulatory requirements  
- Facilitates migration or abstraction as APIs evolve

### Trade-Offs

- Additional complexity via proxy layers and key rotation  
- Slight latency introduced by pre-/post-processing filters  
- May restrict certain experimental workflows without additional approval

## Alternatives Considered

- Direct use of OpenAI/Anthropic APIs in codebases  
  → Fast for prototyping but unsafe and untrackable at scale.

- Full isolation from external LLM APIs  
  → Safe but limits innovation and rapid capability deployment.

## Lifecycle and Governance

- Security team defines provider assessment and review criteria  
- API gateway policies codified and reviewed monthly  
- Usage dashboards shared with product leads and compliance teams  
- Incident response playbooks established for API anomalies or vendor outages
