# ADR-028: Cross-Account Role Federation Strategy

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD  
**Deciders**: Chief Architect, Cloud Security Architect, IAM Governance Lead  
**Context Level**: Identity and Access Management (IAM) in Multi-Account Cloud Environments

## Context

As enterprise cloud usage scales across multiple accounts (e.g., production, staging, shared services, data platforms), users and services need access to resources outside their home account while maintaining:

- Least-privilege access  
- Centralized identity governance  
- Federated auditing and traceability  
- Automated provisioning and deprovisioning

Traditional IAM user models are not scalable or secure in such environments. Instead, role federation—especially using AWS IAM roles and Azure RBAC with Entra ID—is the preferred mechanism for secure, governed cross-account access.

## Decision

Implement a **Cross-Account Role Federation Strategy** using:

1. **Identity Federation via SSO/AAD** — all human users authenticate via enterprise identity providers  
2. **IAM Role Assumption** — service-to-service and human access mediated via short-lived tokens  
3. **Resource-Based Policies** — explicitly permit trusted roles from other accounts  
4. **IAM Boundaries and Tags** — define scope, purpose, and expiration metadata for each role  
5. **Central Role Mapping Registry** — maintain source-of-truth for cross-account permissions

In AWS, use `sts:AssumeRole` with conditions. In Azure, assign Entra ID groups to scoped role assignments across subscriptions.

## Rationale

- **CIO Alignment**: Enables centralized auditability, rapid user onboarding/offboarding, and SSO-based controls  
- **CTO Alignment**: Supports flexible service-to-service workflows across deployment environments  
- **Chief Architect Alignment**: Promotes scalable and maintainable security boundaries in platform design

## Consequences

### Benefits

- **Centralized Control**: Enterprise SSO manages authentication and role mapping  
- **Least Privilege**: Roles scoped tightly to account, service, and use case  
- **Reduced Credential Risk**: Short-lived session tokens and no long-term IAM keys  
- **Cross-Cloud Ready**: Strategy extensible to Azure, GCP, and hybrid clouds

### Trade-Offs

- **Initial Setup Complexity**: Requires configuring trust policies, role registries, and tagging conventions  
- **Policy Drift Risk**: Without automated checks, assumed roles may exceed intended access  
- **Training Needs**: Developers and operators must understand federation flow and assumptions

## Alternatives Considered

- **Static IAM Users with Shared Secrets**  
  Risky and hard to manage; lacks centralized audit trail and violates zero-trust principles.

- **Manual Role Switching**  
  Operationally cumbersome, prone to misconfiguration, and lacks observability.

## Lifecycle and Governance

- Roles provisioned via IaC and tracked with owner, TTL, and sensitivity tags  
- Access reviewed quarterly and auto-rotated based on expiration policies  
- Role assumption events logged to centralized SIEM (e.g., CloudTrail, Azure Monitor)  
- CI/CD tokens also follow short-lived assumption and scoped permissions
