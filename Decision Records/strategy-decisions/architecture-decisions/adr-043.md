# ADR-043: Model Evaluation Framework for LLM and Classical ML

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD  
**Deciders**: Chief Architect, ML Ops Lead, Data Science Governance Board  
**Context Level**: Model Development Lifecycle, Validation and Quality Assurance

## Context

As organizations scale the use of both traditional machine learning (ML) models and large language models (LLMs), the need for consistent and rigorous **evaluation frameworks** becomes critical.

Common challenges include:

- Inconsistent metrics and benchmarks across use cases  
- Lack of agreement on what constitutes acceptable performance  
- No unified platform to compare experiments or model versions  
- Limited visibility into regression, bias, and hallucination risks

A shared, transparent evaluation framework ensures reliable deployment of AI models across domains and fosters confidence in business decisions.

## Decision

Implement a **Unified Model Evaluation Framework** supporting both LLMs and classical ML models.

### Core Components:

1. **Standard Metric Taxonomy**  
   - Regression: MAE, RMSE, R²  
   - Classification: Precision, Recall, F1, ROC-AUC  
   - LLM: BLEU, ROUGE, factuality, toxicity, hallucination rate, response coherence

2. **Dataset Versioning & Benchmark Suites**  
   - Evaluation datasets registered and versioned in DVC or MLflow  
   - Golden sets curated for recurring test cases

3. **Evaluation Pipelines**  
   - Automated CI-based runs with per-model and per-feature slice analysis  
   - Support for prompt/response pair comparisons in LLMs

4. **Visual Dashboards & Leaderboards**  
   - Compare current vs previous model performance  
   - View bias, error distribution, latency, and throughput

5. **Promotion Criteria**  
   - Quantitative thresholds defined per use case  
   - Human-in-the-loop QA and red-teaming for LLMs before production

## Rationale

- **CIO Alignment**: Ensures traceability, accountability, and risk transparency  
- **CTO Alignment**: Reduces deployment failure risk and supports fast iteration  
- **Chief Architect Alignment**: Enforces standardization and governance across model types

## Consequences

### Benefits

- Increases confidence in AI decision-making processes  
- Enables apples-to-apples comparisons across models and data slices  
- Supports regulatory compliance and internal governance audits  
- Encourages a culture of testing and data-driven ML improvement

### Trade-Offs

- Upfront investment in tooling and dataset preparation  
- Requires buy-in from DS/ML teams to adopt evaluation standards  
- LLM evaluation remains partly subjective — needs hybrid human+automated approach

## Alternatives Considered

- Ad hoc Jupyter-based evaluation notebooks  
  → Not repeatable or scalable across teams.

- Relying on vendor metrics for LLMs  
  → Opaque and non-customizable for domain-specific requirements.

## Lifecycle and Governance

- Evaluation templates owned by AI Platform Engineering  
- Model release requires passing predefined evaluation gates  
- Red-teaming playbooks reviewed quarterly and documented in MLOps wiki  
- Feedback loop from users incorporated via post-deployment monitoring
