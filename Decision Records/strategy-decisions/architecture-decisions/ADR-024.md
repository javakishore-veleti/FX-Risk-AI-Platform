# ADR-024: Domain-Driven Modularity for Service Isolation

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD  
**Deciders**: Chief Architect, Domain Owners, Platform Engineering Lead  
**Context Level**: Platform Architecture, Service Design, Team Topology

## Context

As platform capabilities grow, multiple teams contribute domain-specific features such as claims ingestion, forecasting, dispute resolution, AI auditing, and orchestration. Without clear domain boundaries and isolation, challenges arise:

- Shared codebases become hard to evolve safely  
- Cross-team changes lead to regression risks  
- Security and compliance policies are inconsistently applied  
- Engineering velocity suffers from coordination overhead and lack of ownership clarity

Domain-driven modularity aims to align service boundaries with business capabilities, enabling independent delivery, compliance, and observability.

## Decision

Adopt a **Domain-Driven Modularity** strategy where:

- Platform functionality is split into **well-bounded domains** (e.g., Forecasting, Triage, Audit, Orchestration)  
- Each domain maps to **one or more isolated services**, APIs, and data stores  
- Services are **owned by autonomous teams** with clear SLAs and lifecycle responsibility  
- Domains expose **stable contracts** (API and events) and versioned interfaces  
- Cross-domain dependencies are managed via contracts, not code sharing

Each domain is versioned, governed, and documented with ownership and interface definitions.

## Rationale

- **CIO Alignment**: Aligns delivery and accountability with business value streams  
- **CTO Alignment**: Enables faster delivery, parallel development, and domain-specific scaling  
- **Chief Architect Alignment**: Ensures modularity, isolation, and well-formed integration patterns

## Consequences

### Benefits

- **Team Autonomy**: Each domain can evolve and release independently  
- **Security and Compliance**: Policies applied at the domain boundary (IAM, data encryption, audit logs)  
- **Reusability**: Shared services accessed via contracts, not entangled libraries  
- **Scalability**: Performance tuning and scaling done per domain usage pattern

### Trade-Offs

- **Boundary Definition Overhead**: Requires up-front design and ongoing governance  
- **Cross-Domain Coordination**: Changes spanning domains require contracts, not shared classes  
- **Tooling Needs**: Requires contract testing, domain-specific CI/CD lanes, and versioning support

## Alternatives Considered

- **Monorepo with Shared Libraries**  
  Easier to start but leads to tight coupling, difficult permissioning, and runtime interdependencies.

- **Flat Service Mesh Without Domain Boundaries**  
  Promotes fragmentation and team confusion over ownership and SLAs.

## Lifecycle and Governance

- Each domain registers its APIs, events, owners, and contact points in the platform service catalog  
- Cross-domain dependencies must be declared and versioned explicitly  
- Quarterly domain reviews evaluate ownership, security, usage metrics, and evolution needs  
- All new modules must declare domain alignment and boundary context
