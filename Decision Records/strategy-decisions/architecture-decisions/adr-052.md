# ADR-052: Runtime Prompt Injection and Content Safety Filters

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD  
**Deciders**: Chief Architect, Security Engineering Lead, LLM Safety Guild  
**Context Level**: LLM Risk Management, Input/Output Filtering, Application Security

## Context

As enterprise applications incorporate LLMs, they become susceptible to **prompt injection attacks** — malicious user inputs that manipulate or override system instructions. Risks include:

- Leaking sensitive internal information  
- Generating offensive or non-compliant content  
- Altering business logic through crafted instructions  
- Exploiting chain-of-thought or retrieval weaknesses

These vulnerabilities must be mitigated through structured input/output filtering and validation layers at runtime.

## Decision

Implement **Runtime Prompt Injection and Content Safety Filters** as a mandatory security layer around all LLM interactions.

### Key Filter Components:

1. **Input Sanitization**  
   - Strip or neutralize known override tokens, meta-prompts, and adversarial patterns  
   - Detect common obfuscation tactics (e.g., unicode homoglyphs, spacing)

2. **Input Classification**  
   - Use zero-shot or fine-tuned classifiers to detect:  
     - Jailbreak attempts  
     - PII or PHI  
     - Toxicity, profanity, or prompt chaining

3. **Contextual Prompt Wrapping**  
   - Encode system prompts with semantic reinforcement or instruction anchoring  
   - Validate context size and structural integrity before passing to model

4. **Output Post-Processing Filters**  
   - Scan responses for known violations: factuality gaps, abuse, hallucinations  
   - Use regex and LLM-based classifiers for multi-layered moderation

5. **Logging and Incident Alerts**  
   - Tag and store all filtered input/output attempts  
   - Trigger alerts for policy breaches or pattern thresholds

## Rationale

- **CIO Alignment**: Protects against reputational, regulatory, and ethical failures  
- **CTO Alignment**: Prevents misuse and ensures trust in user-facing AI  
- **Chief Architect Alignment**: Encapsulates prompt security as a first-class concern in system architecture

## Consequences

### Benefits

- Prevents a growing class of AI-native vulnerabilities  
- Makes LLM usage safer across regulated and open domains  
- Enhances auditability and incident response capabilities  
- Enables compliance with evolving AI regulations

### Trade-Offs

- May reject valid prompts in edge cases (false positives)  
- Adds complexity to LLM orchestration layer  
- Requires tuning and governance to avoid over-filtering

## Alternatives Considered

- Assume prompts are safe by default  
  → Extremely risky; proven attack vector in public systems.

- Filter only output but not input  
  → Allows model behavior to be compromised before filtering.

## Lifecycle and Governance

- Filter libraries version-controlled and updated via CI/CD  
- Violations reviewed weekly by security and red-teaming committee  
- Filter performance metrics (precision, recall) monitored for quality  
- Policy thresholds aligned with risk tiers and domains
