# ADR-041: Infrastructure as Code for Environment Consistency

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD  
**Deciders**: Chief Architect, DevOps Lead, Cloud Platform Team  
**Context Level**: Cloud Architecture, Deployment Automation, Security and Compliance

## Context

Inconsistencies across cloud environments (dev, staging, prod) can lead to:

- Undocumented manual configuration drift  
- Security posture gaps (e.g., IAM roles, logging not enforced equally)  
- Unreproducible bugs during promotion or rollback  
- Delays in environment provisioning and onboarding new services

Cloud infrastructure must be treated as a first-class asset, managed with reproducible, version-controlled practices — i.e., **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**.

## Decision

Adopt **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** practices to standardize cloud environment provisioning and management.

### Core Practices:

1. **IaC Tooling Standardization**  
   - Terraform (multi-cloud), AWS CDK, Azure Bicep, or Pulumi adopted across all projects  
   - Modules and templates reused across services

2. **Version-Controlled IaC Repositories**  
   - IaC code maintained in Git with clear structure per environment  
   - Pull requests required for all infra changes

3. **Environment-Specific Configs**  
   - Parameterized inputs per environment (`dev`, `test`, `stage`, `prod`)  
   - Shared secrets accessed via vaults, not hardcoded

4. **Automated CI/CD for Infra**  
   - Plan → Review → Apply enforced via CI pipelines  
   - Drift detection integrated with dashboards and alerting

5. **Security and Compliance Guardrails**  
   - Static checks using tools like Checkov, tfsec, Open Policy Agent (OPA)  
   - Auditable change history and rollback capability

## Rationale

- **CIO Alignment**: Guarantees policy-compliant environments and audit-readiness  
- **CTO Alignment**: Improves velocity, reduces manual errors, and simplifies onboarding  
- **Chief Architect Alignment**: Promotes architectural consistency and decoupled infra modules

## Consequences

### Benefits

- Rapid and reliable environment provisioning  
- Consistent resource configurations reduce misconfigurations  
- Easier to replicate, destroy, or migrate environments  
- Improved collaboration between DevOps and developers

### Trade-Offs

- Requires skill ramp-up for teams unfamiliar with IaC tools  
- Changes must go through PR lifecycle (slightly longer than manual fixes)  
- IaC modules and templates must be governed and maintained

## Alternatives Considered

- Manual environment provisioning via console or CLI  
  → Fast for small teams but leads to configuration drift and untracked changes.

- Environment scripts without formal templates  
  → Partial automation but lacks validation, reuse, and security coverage.

## Lifecycle and Governance

- Platform Engineering team owns and audits shared IaC modules  
- CI pipelines must pass security scan and policy tests before deployment  
- Monthly drift detection against desired state  
- Infra state changes logged and reviewed via Git PRs and dashboards
