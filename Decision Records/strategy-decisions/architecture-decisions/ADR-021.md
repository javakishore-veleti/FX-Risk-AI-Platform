# ADR-021: Azure AI Search as a Strategic Retrieval Layer

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD  
**Deciders**: Chief Architect, Head of AI/ML, Azure Platform Lead  
**Context Level**: AI Retrieval Architecture and Multi-Cloud Integration Strategy

## Context

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) workflows are foundational to grounding LLM outputs in enterprise knowledge, policies, and operational documents. While internal systems leverage vector stores like Pinecone or OpenSearch, cross-cloud or Microsoft-native integrations require:

- Federated access to internal and Microsoft-hosted content  
- Strong semantic search, vector support, and metadata filtering  
- Integration with Azure-native security (AAD) and data residency compliance  
- Use in hybrid retrieval stacks where multiple clouds or services participate in prompt grounding

Azure AI Search offers a scalable and secure solution with semantic and hybrid (vector + keyword) retrieval, tight Azure integration, and cognitive enrichment capabilities.

## Decision

Adopt **Azure AI Search** as a strategic component in the retrieval layer architecture, specifically for:

- Semantic grounding in RAG stacks that operate within or integrate with Azure ecosystems  
- Federated search across Microsoft 365, SharePoint, or Azure-based content repositories  
- Metadata-rich document filtering and retrieval within LLM orchestration flows  
- Hybrid deployments that require multi-cloud grounding (e.g., AWS-hosted LLMs + Azure document source)

Azure AI Search indexes will be versioned, tagged, and accessible via REST or SDK APIs within RAG orchestrators.

## Rationale

- **CIO Alignment**: Enables secure AI search across Microsoft content stores, with compliance alignment  
- **CTO Alignment**: Supports scalable retrieval with semantic ranking, vector filtering, and Azure-native pipelines  
- **Chief Architect Alignment**: Promotes modular retrieval strategies, supporting RAG composability and multi-cloud AI integration

## Consequences

### Benefits

- **Semantic and Hybrid Search**: Combines vector similarity with traditional text scoring and metadata filters  
- **Security Integration**: Integrates with AAD, supports RBAC, and filters results by user role or document policy  
- **Interoperability**: Enables RAG and enterprise Q&A flows with Azure OpenAI or AWS-hosted LLMs  
- **Cognitive Enrichment**: Allows use of skills like language detection, key phrase extraction, and summarization during indexing

### Trade-Offs

- **Cloud Coupling**: Ties retrieval layer to Azure; abstractions required in non-Azure stacks  
- **Cost and Quota Management**: Requires careful sizing of indexes and query plans for high-volume usage  
- **Operational Complexity**: Index updates and versioning must be coordinated with content publishing workflows

## Alternatives Considered

- **Pinecone/OpenSearch for All Retrieval**  
  Excellent for custom vector search, but lacks deep integration with Microsoft-native content and metadata layers.

- **ElasticSearch Self-Hosted Clusters**  
  Flexible but heavier ops overhead, weaker semantic ranking, and lower integration with Azure ecosystem.

## Lifecycle and Governance

- All indexes must include: version, model used for embedding, metadata schema, and sensitivity classification  
- Retrieval flows must log search queries, scores, and matched documents for audit and traceability  
- Document ingestion pipelines must enforce tagging, chunking, and embedding policies  
- Retrieval accuracy and usage metrics must be monitored continuously and fed into evaluation dashboards
