# ADR-039: AI Output Validation via Rule-Based Contracts

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD  
**Deciders**: Chief Architect, AI Risk Officer, ML Engineering Lead  
**Context Level**: AI Governance, Risk Management, Compliance Architecture

## Context

AI models, especially LLMs and generative systems, may produce outputs that are inconsistent, invalid, biased, or misaligned with business rules. For example:

- An SLA prediction might suggest negative durations  
- A generated response may contain confidential or offensive content  
- A model might hallucinate values outside allowed ranges

Without systematic validation, these outputs risk propagating into downstream systems, eroding trust, and exposing the organization to regulatory scrutiny.

## Decision

Implement a structured mechanism for **AI Output Validation** based on **Rule-Based Contracts**, applied after model inference and before external consumption.

### Key Components:

1. **Validation Contract DSL**  
   - Define rules in a domain-specific language (YAML/JSON/Python)  
   - Support checks like: type, range, regex, enumeration, schema conformity

2. **Post-Inference Hook**  
   - All inference pipelines route output through a validation module  
   - Results include: `valid`, `warnings`, `errors`, `blocked`

3. **Fallback and Alert Strategy**  
   - If validation fails, route to fallback (e.g., human review, default message)  
   - Log violations and alert based on severity

4. **Versioned Validation Rules**  
   - Contracts tracked and versioned along with model version  
   - Promoted to production only after peer review

5. **Logging and Auditability**  
   - All validation decisions logged with input/output snapshot and rule evaluation trail

## Rationale

- **CIO Alignment**: Supports enterprise mandates for explainability, fairness, and accountability  
- **CTO Alignment**: Prevents downstream errors and supports safe scaling  
- **Chief Architect Alignment**: Codifies safeguards as part of platform policy enforcement

## Consequences

### Benefits

- Catch invalid or unsafe outputs before exposure to users or systems  
- Support red-teaming and QA processes with testable criteria  
- Enhance explainability by aligning outputs with explicit rules  
- Build trust with business stakeholders and regulators

### Trade-Offs

- Adds latency and complexity to inference flow  
- Requires consistent rule maintenance and regression testing  
- Risk of overly strict rules suppressing valid edge-case outputs

## Alternatives Considered

- Manual post-hoc review of random samples  
  → Doesn’t scale and cannot guarantee incident prevention.

- Embedded rule logic in prompt templates  
  → Inflexible, not reusable, hard to test independently.

## Lifecycle and Governance

- Validation contracts owned by domain leads and reviewed during model promotion  
- Contracts stored in versioned repo with CI checks  
- Violations tracked via observability dashboard  
- Biannual rule reviews for accuracy, coverage, and effectiveness
