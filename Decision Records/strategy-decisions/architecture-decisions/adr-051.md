# ADR-051: Feedback Loop Instrumentation for Continuous Learning

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD  
**Deciders**: Chief Architect, AI Product Owner, Head of Data Science  
**Context Level**: AI Governance, MLOps, Continuous Improvement

## Context

AI systems are only as valuable as their ability to improve over time. However, many enterprise AI implementations suffer from:

- Lack of structured user feedback on model predictions or LLM responses  
- No formal loop between feedback and model/data improvements  
- Drift in business context without retraining triggers  
- Missed opportunities to identify hallucinations, bias, or usability issues

A **closed feedback loop** is essential to move from "set-and-forget" AI toward continuous learning and adaptation.

## Decision

Establish an **AI Feedback Loop Instrumentation Strategy** to collect, analyze, and apply feedback across AI modules.

### Key Mechanisms:

1. **Explicit User Feedback**  
   - Feedback UI embedded in apps: thumbs up/down, 1–5 stars, text comments  
   - Linked to prompt, model version, context, and user metadata

2. **Implicit Interaction Signals**  
   - Capture user actions post-response (e.g., accept, ignore, retry, escalate)  
   - Use as implicit model quality proxy

3. **Feedback Stores and Labels**  
   - Feedback events stored in labeled datasets for QA, tuning, and red-teaming  
   - Annotation tools allow internal reviewers to relabel or escalate

4. **Monitoring for Drift and Defects**  
   - Aggregate feedback analyzed for score drops, domain-specific failures  
   - Patterns flagged for root cause investigation or retraining

5. **Retraining and Prompt Refinement Integration**  
   - High-quality feedback informs prompt changes, fine-tuning, or hardcoded filters  
   - Evaluation pipelines track improvement from feedback utilization

## Rationale

- **CIO Alignment**: Demonstrates commitment to ethical, explainable, and accountable AI  
- **CTO Alignment**: Drives product-market fit and feature reliability  
- **Chief Architect Alignment**: Codifies model iteration governance into platform lifecycle

## Consequences

### Benefits

- Makes AI system responsive to user and business dynamics  
- Enables rapid refinement cycles for high-impact use cases  
- Generates artifacts for regulatory defense and QA analysis  
- Reduces hallucinations and mismatches over time

### Trade-Offs

- Requires UI and API changes to capture feedback signals  
- Needs data governance and label management  
- False feedback or signal noise must be filtered with heuristics

## Alternatives Considered

- Periodic manual evaluation only  
  → Too slow for adaptive AI platforms with frequent changes.

- No feedback loop  
  → Limits model and prompt improvement, reduces user trust.

## Lifecycle and Governance

- Feedback schema and APIs owned by AI Platform Engineering  
- Monthly feedback analytics shared with product and model leads  
- Feedback datasets reviewed quarterly for retraining and prompt tuning  
- Red-team simulations periodically validate feedback effectiveness
