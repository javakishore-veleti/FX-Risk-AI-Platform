# ADR-001: Platform Modular Repository Structure

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-06-07  
**Deciders**: Chief Architect, CTO, CIO  
**Context Level**: Enterprise Platform Architecture

## Context

As modern digital platforms grow in scale and complexity, the need to balance delivery velocity, architectural separation, and cross-functional collaboration becomes critical. A monolithic repository often becomes a bottleneck due to:

- Coupled deployment pipelines and shared runtime risks
- Cross-team friction and difficult boundary enforcement
- Challenges with aligning business capabilities to technical structures
- Inadequate modular traceability for audit, compliance, or change control

Enterprises with multi-domain platforms—particularly those spanning orchestration, analytics, ML, and UX—require a governance structure that enables decentralized delivery while preserving architectural integrity.

## Decision

Establish a **modular multi-repository platform structure**, where each repository reflects a discrete capability, bounded context, or architectural layer. This includes, but is not limited to:

- **UI Repository**: A dedicated web interface or client platform
- **API & Orchestration Repo**: APIs, workflow engines, and domain orchestrators
- **Analytics / Reporting Repo**: Dashboards, data views, and summary engines
- **Data Pipeline Repo**: Streaming, batch, or AI/ML workloads
- **Infrastructure Repo**: Infrastructure as Code (IaC), cloud policy definitions
- **Security / Compliance Repo**: Guardrails, audit, identity workflows
- **Shared Libraries Repo**: SDKs, common logic, logging wrappers, schema definitions
- **Ops / Tooling Repo**: Scripts, automation, deployment helpers
- **Documentation Repo**: Umbrella repo with ADRs, BDAT models, roadmap summaries

## Rationale

- **CIO Priority**: Aligns platform components with business value streams and enables capability-based budget traceability
- **CTO Priority**: Empowers autonomous teams, supports service decomposition, and streamlines DevSecOps enforcement
- **Chief Architect Priority**: Enforces system separation by architecture layer (BDAT), simplifies review cycles, and improves lifecycle governance

## Consequences

### Benefits

- **Scalability**: Teams operate independently with clear boundaries
- **Auditability**: Security, compliance, and traceability concerns can be localized per repo
- **Flexibility**: Services and components evolve with different lifecycle cadences
- **Clarity**: Product managers, risk leads, and engineering heads can map deliverables to technical repositories

### Drawbacks

- **Cross-repo Integration**: Requires meta-pipelines, integration tests, and dependency visibility tooling
- **Onboarding Overhead**: New contributors must navigate more repositories and interfaces
- **Governance Effort**: Requires consistent ADR, versioning, and changelog policies across repos

## Alternatives Considered

- **Single Mono-Repo**: Simpler in tooling and global refactors, but breaks down under scale, and complicates domain isolation, compliance, and ownership clarity
- **Layered Repo Model** (e.g., frontend/backend/data): Insufficient for capability-based delivery in cross-functional teams

## Lifecycle and Governance

This decision is marked as **Accepted**. It will be re-evaluated if:
- Platform scope changes significantly (e.g., consolidation or multi-cloud abstraction layer)
- Integration complexity or cognitive load outweighs repo boundary benefits
- Org structure changes (e.g., shift to mono-pod delivery model or platform-as-a-service model)
