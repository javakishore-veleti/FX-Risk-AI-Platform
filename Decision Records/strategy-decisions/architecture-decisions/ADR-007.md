# ADR-007: Angular as the UI Framework

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD  
**Deciders**: Chief Architect, Head of Frontend Engineering, CTO  
**Context Level**: Application Architecture and User Experience (UX) Strategy

## Context

The platform requires a web-based user interface (UI) for interacting with operational dashboards, AI-assist workflows, exception resolution, and audit tools. Requirements include:

- Strong modularity and enterprise-scale routing  
- Role-based UI composition  
- Seamless integration with REST APIs, WebSockets, and federated identity providers  
- Rich form handling, validation, and template-driven views

Multiple frontend frameworks (Angular, React, Vue) are viable. However, Angular offers enterprise-grade structure out of the box with consistent tooling, TypeScript safety, and long-term maintainability.

## Decision

Adopt **Angular** as the standard framework for the platform’s web-based frontend applications.

## Rationale

- **CIO Alignment**: Supports rapid delivery of unified UX across business units, with reuse of secure authentication and authorization patterns  
- **CTO Alignment**: Type-safe, CLI-driven, and scalable for large teams; integrates cleanly with DevOps and CI/CD pipelines  
- **Chief Architect Alignment**: Promotes a component-based architecture that maps directly to business capabilities (exception routing, dashboarding, forecasting UI)

## Consequences

### Benefits

- **Opinionated Architecture**: Encourages consistency across teams and enforces clear separation of concerns  
- **Tooling**: Includes CLI generators, testing utilities, and Ahead-of-Time (AoT) compilation by default  
- **Maintainability**: Scalable for large applications due to typed templates, dependency injection, and modular routing  
- **Security**: Integrates well with OAuth2, OIDC, SSO, and JWT-based auth flows

### Trade-Offs

- **Steep Learning Curve**: Initial onboarding time is higher compared to lightweight frameworks  
- **Bundle Size**: Larger initial payload unless optimized with lazy loading and tree shaking  
- **Perceived Developer Overhead**: Teams used to React/Vue may need structured upskilling

## Alternatives Considered

- **React**  
  Offers more flexibility and wider developer pool, but requires assembling routing, state, and form libraries manually.

- **Vue.js**  
  Lightweight and beginner-friendly, but less commonly adopted in large-scale enterprise platforms.

- **Web Components / Micro Frontends**  
  Useful for domain isolation, but higher integration and state-sharing complexity at platform scale.

## Lifecycle and Governance

- All frontend modules must follow Angular’s CLI and workspace layout for maintainability  
- Common components (headers, auth flows, dashboards) must be extracted into shared libraries  
- Accessibility (a11y), performance budgets, and test coverage must be tracked via CI
