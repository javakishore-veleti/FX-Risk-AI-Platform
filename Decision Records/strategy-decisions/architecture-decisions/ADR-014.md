# ADR-014: LLM Evaluation Framework for Prompt Safety and Quality

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD  
**Deciders**: Chief Architect, Head of AI/ML, Risk & Compliance Lead  
**Context Level**: AI System Testing, Prompt Engineering, and Governance

## Context

As large language models (LLMs) are integrated into business-critical workflows, there is a need to ensure:

- Prompts yield accurate, consistent, and business-appropriate outputs  
- Responses are free from hallucinations, bias, or harmful content  
- AI behaviors are reproducible and traceable  
- Prompt quality and risk are evaluated before reaching production environments

Without a standardized evaluation layer, teams may unknowingly deploy unsafe or underperforming prompts into high-stakes domains like exception handling, regulatory communication, or forecasting.

## Decision

Establish an **LLM Evaluation Framework** that supports:

- Automated prompt-output testing using golden test cases  
- Output scoring via metrics (e.g., correctness, relevance, toxicity, completeness)  
- Regression testing as part of CI/CD for prompts  
- Role-based gating for risky or experimental prompts (e.g., allow only in sandbox/test)

The framework will run in offline evaluation mode, as well as runtime post-hoc analysis with sampled logs.

## Rationale

- **CIO Alignment**: Ensures brand integrity, safety, and regulatory alignment for AI-assisted communication  
- **CTO Alignment**: Enables continuous testing and MLOps guardrails for LLM lifecycle  
- **Chief Architect Alignment**: Makes prompt quality a testable unit, subject to versioning and traceability

## Consequences

### Benefits

- **Risk Mitigation**: Flags prompts that could mislead users, generate harmful output, or create legal exposure  
- **CI-Integrated Testing**: Developers can run prompt checks before merge or deployment  
- **Baseline Tracking**: Model performance regressions can be detected early  
- **Policy Enforcement**: Unsafe prompt patterns can be blocked or flagged for human review

### Trade-Offs

- **Initial Setup Overhead**: Requires curation of test prompts, golden outputs, and evaluator rules  
- **Subjectivity in Metrics**: Some quality measures may require manual or hybrid review initially  
- **Ongoing Maintenance**: New prompt types and workflows will need expanded test suites

## Alternatives Considered

- **Manual Review of Prompt Behavior**  
  Slow, inconsistent, and error-proneâ€”especially as prompt surface area grows.

- **Trusting LLM Output as-is**  
  Fast to ship, but unverified responses introduce unacceptable risk in enterprise domains.

## Lifecycle and Governance

- Each prompt in production must pass evaluation gate or carry explicit exemption tags  
- Evaluation logs must be stored for traceability and monitored for false positives/negatives  
- Prompt regression dashboards must be available to AI/ML and platform engineering teams  
- Evaluator logic must be version-controlled and reviewed like any code artifact
