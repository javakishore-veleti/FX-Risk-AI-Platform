# ADR-027: DevSecOps Alignment with Enterprise Risk Frameworks

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD  
**Deciders**: Chief Architect, CISO, DevOps Governance Lead  
**Context Level**: Secure SDLC, Policy-as-Code, and Platform Governance

## Context

As DevOps practices accelerate deployment velocity across microservices, data pipelines, and AI models, security risks multiply—particularly when delivery pipelines are siloed, manual security reviews are delayed, and controls lack enforcement.

Enterprise risk functions (e.g., InfoSec, Legal, Compliance) require consistent policy observability, traceability of changes, and enforceable controls that span the development lifecycle.

DevSecOps principles embed these requirements into the build, deploy, and monitor phases of software delivery—via automation, policy-as-code, and shift-left validation.

## Decision

Adopt a **DevSecOps-aligned delivery model**, integrating enterprise risk management principles into CI/CD workflows by:

1. **Embedding Policy-as-Code (PaC)** — using tools like OPA/Gatekeeper, Checkov, and Conftest  
2. **Enforcing CI/CD controls** — validate IaC, image scanning, secrets, and open-source licenses  
3. **Enabling Audit Hooks** — log source, identity, hash, and provenance of all deployable artifacts  
4. **Segmenting Environments** — apply change management gates by environment (dev/test/prod)  
5. **Providing Dashboards** — aggregate control violations, drift detection, and policy exceptions

This model is implemented through shared pipeline templates, central governance libraries, and architecture review checkpoints.

## Rationale

- **CIO Alignment**: Demonstrates proactive risk posture, supports ISO/SOC/FISMA controls  
- **CTO Alignment**: Enables secure delivery at scale without blocking engineering velocity  
- **Chief Architect Alignment**: Promotes uniform guardrails, cross-domain traceability, and dev productivity

## Consequences

### Benefits

- **Automation of Controls**: Reduces manual review bottlenecks while improving auditability  
- **Shift Left**: Engineers catch issues at merge time—earlier and cheaper to resolve  
- **Policy Transparency**: All control logic is codified, versioned, and reviewable  
- **Platform Trust**: Cross-team services inherit and share security best practices

### Trade-Offs

- **Tooling Investment**: Requires initial setup of policy engines, security scanners, and CI/CD integration  
- **Learning Curve**: Engineers must understand policies, violations, and exception workflows  
- **False Positives**: Policies need tuning to avoid over-blocking and alert fatigue

## Alternatives Considered

- **Manual Security Reviews**  
  High friction, not scalable, and leads to inconsistent enforcement and delays.

- **Siloed Security Teams**  
  Lacks ownership at engineering layer, often applied late in delivery lifecycle.

## Lifecycle and Governance

- Security control libraries managed centrally, but embedded into team pipelines  
- Control violations tracked, triaged, and surfaced to developers with context  
- Annual alignment with enterprise risk frameworks and compliance audits  
- Escalation workflows defined for policy exceptions, overrides, and compensating controls
