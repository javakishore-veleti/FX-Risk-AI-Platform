# ADR-030: Tagging Standards for Resource Ownership and Compliance

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD  
**Deciders**: Chief Architect, Cloud Governance Lead, FinOps Analyst  
**Context Level**: Cloud Resource Management, Audit Readiness, Cost Tracking

## Context

In a multi-cloud, multi-account environment, cloud resources—such as compute instances, storage buckets, pipelines, and AI services—are provisioned by various teams across environments. Without consistent tagging:

- Ownership is unclear, leading to orphaned resources and security risk  
- Cost allocation is inaccurate or impossible  
- Compliance reporting and traceability degrade over time  
- Platform governance lacks visibility into what exists, why, and where it operates

Standardized tagging helps address these issues by embedding metadata into every resource, enabling automation, analysis, and control.

## Decision

Adopt and enforce **organizational tagging standards** that must be applied to all cloud-deployed assets. At minimum, each resource must include:

| Tag Key             | Description                                      |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `Owner`             | Email or alias of responsible team or person     |
| `Environment`       | One of: `dev`, `test`, `stage`, `prod`           |
| `Domain`            | Logical business domain or service group         |
| `DataSensitivity`   | One of: `Public`, `Internal`, `Restricted`, etc. |
| `CostCenter`        | Aligned to finance/budget codes                  |
| `Lifecycle`         | Expected TTL or `permanent`                      |
| `Criticality`       | One of: `Low`, `Medium`, `High`                  |

Optional tags may include `Project`, `ComplianceScope`, `BackupPolicy`, or `ArchitectureOwner`.

Tagging will be enforced at deploy-time using IaC validation (e.g., Terraform, CloudFormation, Bicep), pre-deploy hooks, and CI checks.

## Rationale

- **CIO Alignment**: Enables better cost reporting, compliance readiness, and accountability  
- **CTO Alignment**: Improves hygiene, discoverability, and lifecycle management  
- **Chief Architect Alignment**: Supports platform observability, security posture, and traceable lineage

## Consequences

### Benefits

- **Ownership Visibility**: Clear escalation and remediation for alerts, risks, and incidents  
- **Cost Optimization**: Accurate chargebacks and budget enforcement  
- **Audit Readiness**: Rapid resource inventory filtered by domain, sensitivity, and usage  
- **Automation**: Enforces policies like TTL cleanup, backup scope, or encryption status

### Trade-Offs

- **Developer Effort**: Initial tagging may feel like overhead if tooling is not integrated  
- **Tag Drift**: Risk of outdated or incorrect tags if not validated continuously  
- **Legacy Resources**: Requires retrofit of existing deployments or exception handling

## Alternatives Considered

- **Freeform or Optional Tagging**  
  Leads to inconsistent data, gaps in automation, and audit frustration.

- **Manual Inventory Management**  
  Incomplete, hard to scale, and unreliable for real-time insights.

## Lifecycle and Governance

- Tag dictionaries maintained by platform governance and finance teams  
- Tag completeness scored as part of security and compliance dashboards  
- Tag validation embedded in pre-merge CI checks and IaC pipelines  
- Unowned or untagged resources flagged for cleanup/escalation
