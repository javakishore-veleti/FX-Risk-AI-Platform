# Data Architecture Principles

## Ownership

- **Document Owner**: Chief Architect, Fx-Risk-AI Platform
- **Review Cadence**: Annual or in response to changes in data pipeline design, data products, or compliance policies

## Audience

This document is intended for:

- Data Engineers and Architects
- Platform and Application Engineers
- Compliance, Audit, and Risk Teams
- AI/ML and Analytics Engineers

## Governance

- All services and workflows must explicitly define data ownership, lineage, and access boundaries
- Architecture and data platform reviews evaluate alignment to these principles
- Deviations require recorded rationale and compensating controls in data decision records

## Automation and Tooling Enablers

- **Data Catalog**: Central registry of datasets, owners, schema, lineage, and classifications
- **Schema Registry**: Enforce schema evolution, compatibility checks, and deprecation warnings
- **Lineage Tracing**: Automated logging of data hops from ingestion to model to dashboard
- **Access Control Policies**: Fine-grained IAM and Lake Formation policies applied to S3, Glue, Athena, and Redshift

## Principle Set

### 1. Data as a Strategic Asset

- Every dataset must have a clear owner, business purpose, and documented schema
- Data should be treated as a product with consumers, contracts, and quality SLAs

### 2. Domain Ownership of Data

- Data is produced and governed by the business domain that owns it (e.g., Desk Forecasts, Exception Audit)
- Cross-domain consumption happens via well-defined interfaces (e.g., API, Athena, Glue Catalog)

### 3. Immutable Event Sourcing

- Data should be modeled as append-only, time-stamped, immutable events wherever possible
- Support traceability and reprocessing with minimal risk of corruption

### 4. Schema Evolution and Compatibility

- All breaking schema changes must follow versioning policies
- Consumers must be backward-compatible or notified of changes in advance

### 5. Encryption and Data Protection

- Encrypt all data at rest using KMS (S3, Redshift, RDS, Glue)
- Encrypt all data in transit using TLS 1.2+
- PII must be masked or tokenized based on sensitivity classification

### 6. Auditability and Lineage

- Track every data movement from ingestion → transform → AI → dashboard
- Store source system metadata, transformation logic, and model versions

### 7. Reusability Over Redundancy

- Avoid duplicating the same data across teams or systems
- Promote shared data assets via Glue, Athena, Redshift Spectrum, and APIs

### 8. Time-Aware and Late-Binding Pipelines

- Pipelines should capture time context and support backfills or replays
- Avoid early joins or filters — favor enriching data as close to consumption as possible

### 9. Secure and Observable Sharing

- Data sharing must be logged, role-scoped, and policy-controlled
- Alert on anomalous access or data egress patterns

### 10. Ready for Analytics and AI

- Data must be structured, labeled, and complete enough to support analytics, dashboards, and ML
- Promote usage of shared data prep layers (e.g., `fx-risk-ai-forecasting-pipeline`, `fx-risk-ai-insights-engine`)
