## Purpose

This document outlines vendor-neutral architectural principles for designing systems using serverless paradigms across cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP). These principles enable scalability, resilience, and faster time-to-market, while preserving governance and cost control.

---

## 1. Statelessness and Ephemerality

- Functions and containers must not retain local state between invocations.  
- Session data must be stored externally (e.g., in databases, object stores, or managed caches).  
- Functions should be idempotent to support retries and parallel execution.

---

## 2. Event-Driven Architecture by Default

- Use triggers (events, schedules, message queues) as the primary mechanism to initiate workloads.  
- Design workflows with decoupling and eventual consistency in mind.  
- Orchestration and choreography should be handled through serverless workflow services or custom patterns.

---

## 3. Micro-Function Decomposition

- Break down services into focused, composable functions.  
- Avoid monolithic Lambdas or bloated Azure Functions.  
- Keep execution units small, testable, and version-controlled.

---

## 4. Observability Built-In

- Implement structured logging, metrics, and distributed tracing from the start.  
- Propagate context (e.g., correlation IDs) through all events and services.  
- Export telemetry to central observability platforms (e.g., CloudWatch, Application Insights, Stackdriver).

---

## 5. Principle of Least Privilege

- Each function or service should have narrowly scoped permissions.  
- Use managed identities or IAM roles instead of static keys or credentials.  
- Apply resource-based policies and endpoint controls to restrict surface area.

---

## 6. Infrastructure as Code

- Use declarative IaC tools (e.g., Terraform, AWS SAM, Azure Bicep, Pulumi) for all serverless resources.  
- Promote modular, reusable templates with security and compliance baked in.  
- Validate policies (e.g., tagging, encryption) as part of CI pipelines.

---

## 7. Cold Start and Performance Awareness

- Choose runtimes, memory, and architecture settings based on latency needs.  
- Use provisioned concurrency or warmup techniques for latency-critical paths.  
- Profile workloads regularly to right-size execution environments.

---

## 8. Cost Visibility and Guardrails

- Apply usage tagging to all serverless resources.  
- Monitor cost patterns and set budget alerts per environment/team.  
- Leverage cost-aware architecture decisions (e.g., batching, deduplication, cache).

---

## 9. Multi-Tenancy and Domain Separation

- Where appropriate, isolate functions by tenant, product, or business domain.  
- Use context-aware routers or dispatchers to enforce tenant boundaries.  
- Ensure that logs and monitoring data are segregated accordingly.

---

## 10. API and Event Gateway Patterns

- Use API Gateways and Event Brokers (e.g., EventBridge, Pub/Sub) to standardize entry points.  
- Apply throttling, caching, validation, and authentication at the gateway level.  
- Expose asynchronous interfaces where latency is non-critical.
