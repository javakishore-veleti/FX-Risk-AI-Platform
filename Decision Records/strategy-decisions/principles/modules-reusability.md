# Modules Reusability Principles

## Ownership

- **Document Owner**: Chief Architect, Fx-Risk-AI Platform  
- **Review Cadence**: Quarterly or in response to platform-scale refactors or shared component evolution

## Audience

This document is intended for:

- Application Developers  
- Tech Leads and Architects  
- CI/CD Pipeline Maintainers  
- DevOps and Shared Library Owners

## Governance

- New modules must be evaluated for reuse potential and naming alignment  
- Changes to shared modules must be versioned and documented  
- All services must justify duplication if not reusing available platform components

## Automation and Tooling Enablers

- **Shared Libs Registry**: Central catalog of reusable packages and components  
- **Scaffolding CLI**: Auto-import reusable modules during project bootstrap  
- **Dependency Policy Scanners**: Detect local copies of shared modules and prompt migration  
- **Versioning Frameworks**: Semantic versioning (semver), changelogs, and deprecation alerts

## Principle Set

### 1. Reuse Before Rebuild

- Teams must first consult the platform registry before building similar modules  
- Encourage reuse of models, prompt templates, routing patterns, and API scaffolds

### 2. Domain-Aligned Libraries

- Group reusable modules by functional domain (e.g., Audit, Forecasting, Prompting)  
- Avoid overly generic utilities with unclear ownership or purpose

### 3. Explicit Ownership

- Every shared module must have a named owner (team or repo)  
- Ownership includes maintaining, versioning, and deprecation lifecycle

### 4. Versioned and Backward Compatible

- All reusable modules must follow semantic versioning (`major.minor.patch`)  
- Major version bumps must signal breaking changes and migration plans

### 5. Test Coverage and CI Enforcement

- Shared modules must include unit tests, linting, and type-checking  
- CI pipelines must block PRs that reduce test coverage or introduce regressions

### 6. Language-Specific Conventions

- Python modules: published to internal PyPI or Git submodules  
- JavaScript modules: publish via private npm or direct Git install  
- Use a consistent namespace (e.g., `fxai.audit.log_utils`, `@fxai-ui/table-core`)

### 7. Documentation and Examples

- Every module must include a `README.md` with use cases, example usage, and caveats  
- Complex modules must provide usage snippets or integration tests

### 8. Minimize Hidden Coupling

- Reusable modules must not depend on environment-specific globals, auth context, or side effects  
- Input/output contracts must be clean and mockable

### 9. Promote Composable Units

- Build small, focused modules that can be composed together  
- Avoid monolithic shared libraries that mix unrelated concerns

### 10. Incentivize and Measure Reuse

- Track usage metrics across teams and services  
- Reward teams contributing stable, documented, and widely adopted modules
