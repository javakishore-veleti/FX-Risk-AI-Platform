## Principle Set

### 1. Use Case Scoping and Intent Clarity

- Every NLP use case must define:
  - Input document type and structure  
  - Intended output (classification, entity, summary, answer, etc.)  
  - Constraints (e.g., latency, language, regulatory domain)  
- Avoid ambiguous output classes or vague task definitions

### 2. Data Source Transparency

- Input text must be traceable to a source system or document URI  
- NLP pipeline must store metadata: ingestion time, format, author/source  
- Content origin (e.g., user message vs. legal PDF) must be known before processing

### 3. Language, Region, and Glossary Awareness

- Detect and validate language before applying models  
- Localize tokenizers, stopwords, stemming rules as needed  
- Use finance-domain-specific vocabularies and ontologies for modeling and extraction

### 4. Model Selection Guidelines

- Prefer pretrained transformers or LLMs for:
  - Named entity recognition, topic tagging, summarization, intent detection  
- Use fine-tuned or zero-shot models where labeled data is scarce  
- Baseline every model against open benchmarks (e.g., Financial PhraseBank, SEC-10K) before rollout

### 5. Pipeline Modularity

- Separate pipeline stages:
  - Ingestion  
  - Preprocessing (tokenization, normalization, OCR, etc.)  
  - Inference  
  - Postprocessing (re-ranking, formatting, mapping)  
- Make each component independently replaceable and testable

### 6. Evaluation and Ground Truth

- All NLP components must be evaluated using:
  - Precision, recall, F1, BLEU/ROUGE for summaries, or similarity for embeddings  
- Use desk-annotated ground truth or trusted external corpora  
- Maintain error sets (false positives/negatives) for debugging

### 7. Explainability and Traceability

- Each prediction must be explainable:
  - Attention weights, highlighted spans, or supporting sentences  
- Maintain logs with:
  - Model ID/version  
  - Input snippet  
  - Output and confidence score  
  - `trace_id`, user, and system timestamp

### 8. Data Sensitivity and Privacy

- Mask or tokenize PII, customer IDs, account numbers before processing  
- Avoid sending sensitive free-text fields to external APIs or LLMs  
- Maintain encryption in transit and redact logs

### 9. LLM and Hybrid NLP Integration

- Combine structured NLP (NER, POS, regex) with LLMs for flexible parsing  
- Implement fallback and voting strategies when combining rules and models  
- Always document prompt templates, LLM versions, and grounding sources

### 10. Responsible Use and Ethical Guardrails

- Clearly label generated vs. extracted content  
- Disclose confidence thresholds and limitations in UI and documentation  
- Avoid auto-acting on NLP outputs without human validation in regulated workflows
