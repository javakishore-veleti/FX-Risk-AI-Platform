# Data Platform Multi-Tenancy Principles

**Owner**: Chief Data Officer (CDO)  
**Audience**: Data Platform Architects, Engineering Leads, DevOps, Security Architects  
**Governance**: Enterprise Data Council, Platform Review Board  
**Automation**: Enforced via metadata tagging, IAM policies, network segmentation, and platform-level isolation frameworks

## Purpose

This document outlines principles for designing and managing multi-tenant data platforms where multiple internal teams, business units, or external customers securely share a common infrastructure, without data leakage, performance interference, or governance lapses.

---

## 1. Tenant Isolation as a First Principle

- Enforce logical, access, and compute isolation by default.  
- Tenants must not see or impact other tenantsâ€™ data, pipelines, dashboards, or logs.  
- Isolation can be achieved via:  
  - Dedicated namespaces or folders  
  - Resource tagging and scoped policies  
  - Identity and access control boundaries

---

## 2. Metadata-Driven Access Control

- Tag datasets, pipelines, and compute resources with `tenant_id`, `classification`, and `data_domain`.  
- Dynamically resolve access based on metadata during execution.  
- All queries and jobs must be scoped to authorized tenants.

---

## 3. Fine-Grained Identity and Role Boundaries

- Use federated identity providers and RBAC per tenant.  
- Assign data engineer, analyst, auditor roles at tenant level.  
- Access logs should include tenant context for every access event.

---

## 4. Compute Resource Isolation

- Prevent noisy neighbor issues by allocating compute units (e.g., EMR clusters, Databricks workspaces, Lambda concurrency) per tenant or workload type.  
- Use quotas, budgets, and autoscaling to avoid tenant-induced platform risk.

---

## 5. Network and Security Segmentation

- Implement virtual network boundaries (VPC/VNET), subnet tagging, and firewall policies per tenant.  
- Use service endpoints or private links to restrict traffic to tenant-owned resources.  
- Encrypt tenant traffic independently (TLS) and apply tenant-specific key policies (KMS).

---

## 6. Data Lineage and Observability per Tenant

- Trace lineage of data transformations scoped to tenant identity.  
- Enable per-tenant observability for logs, metrics, and pipeline performance.  
- Detect cross-tenant data movements and alert violations.

---

## 7. Billing and Cost Attribution

- Tag and track usage per tenant (compute, storage, events).  
- Report cost summaries for showback or chargeback.  
- Enable automated anomaly detection for spend surges per tenant.

---

## 8. Shared Services with Policy Controls

- Shared data catalog, monitoring stack, or AI model registry should:  
  - Apply visibility filters per tenant  
  - Mask data not authorized for current role  
  - Support tenant-specific versions or branches

---

## 9. Lifecycle Management

- Data retention, archiving, and deletion must be tenant-specific.  
- Expired tenant data must be wiped with audit proof.  
- Deprovisioned tenants must lose all access across services.

---

## 10. Regulatory and Compliance Alignment

- Apply GDPR, HIPAA, SOC2 controls per tenant jurisdiction.  
- Support data residency and sovereignty controls.  
- Maintain audit trails for every tenant-level governance action.
