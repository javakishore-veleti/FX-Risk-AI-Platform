## Purpose

This document outlines the architectural principles and platform considerations when adopting Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) across cloud platforms (e.g., AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, Google Cloud Functions). It ensures that FaaS solutions are scalable, secure, efficient, and easy to operate within an enterprise-grade environment.

---

## 1. Stateless and Ephemeral Design

- Each function should perform a small, atomic task and complete quickly.  
- Maintain no internal state â€” use object stores, databases, or message queues for state.  
- Idempotency should be guaranteed to allow safe retries.

---

## 2. Event-Driven Invocation Model

- Leverage events (HTTP, messaging, file changes, time schedules) to trigger execution.  
- Standardize event formats and metadata for observability and routing.  
- Use asynchronous processing for long-running tasks where feasible.

---

## 3. Secure by Default

- Enforce least-privilege access via scoped identities or IAM roles.  
- Use secret management services to store credentials, API keys, and tokens.  
- Implement input validation and sanitization at function boundaries.

---

## 4. Observability First

- Integrate logs, traces, and custom metrics by default.  
- Correlate invocations with upstream and downstream events (e.g., trace IDs).  
- Alert on latency, cold starts, error rates, and retry spikes.

---

## 5. Multi-Cloud Abstraction Optional

- If portability is desired, abstract FaaS interactions through SDKs, interfaces, or platforms like Knative.  
- Otherwise, design to maximize native integration on the chosen cloud.

---

## 6. Resource Constraints Awareness

- Design with memory and timeout limits in mind.  
- Monitor cold start impact and use warm-up strategies if needed.  
- Split responsibilities across functions to avoid memory bloat or over-provisioning.

---

## 7. Consistent Deployment and Versioning

- All functions should be deployed via CI/CD using Infrastructure-as-Code.  
- Version functions explicitly and maintain changelogs.  
- Use canary or blue-green deployments for critical workloads.

---

## 8. Cost Optimization

- Right-size memory allocation per function profile.  
- Use batching, throttling, and delay strategies to manage concurrency.  
- Leverage per-invocation billing insights to evaluate architectural choices.

---

## 9. Vendor-Specific Optimizations

- Embrace the strengths of the chosen platform (e.g., Step Functions, Logic Apps, Cloud Workflows).  
- Optimize for performance, reliability, and cost with platform-specific best practices.

---

## 10. Governance and Lifecycle

- All functions must have an assigned owner and lifecycle policy.  
- Use tagging for classification (e.g., production, dev, PII-handling).  
- Periodically review function inventory for deprecation or consolidation.
