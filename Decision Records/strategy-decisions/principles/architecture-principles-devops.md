# DevOps Architecture Principles

## Ownership

- **Document Owner**: Chief Architect, Fx-Risk-AI Platform
- **Review Cadence**: Semi-annual or after introducing major new services or deployment pipelines

## Audience

This document is intended for:

- DevOps Engineers
- Site Reliability Engineers (SREs)
- Platform and Infrastructure Engineers
- Security and Release Managers
- Automation Architects

## Governance

- All application and service teams must follow these principles for build, test, and deploy pipelines.
- CI/CD patterns must be reviewed during architecture and platform readiness checks.
- All production deployments must pass through automated gates and policy validations.

## Automation and Tooling Enablers

- **CI/CD Pipelines**: All services must use GitHub Actions or AWS CodePipeline with infrastructure-as-code triggers
- **Static and Security Scanning**: Mandatory in pull requests (e.g., Bandit, Checkov, trivy)
- **Deployment Policies**: Canary or blue-green deploy strategies for critical services
- **Runtime Observability**: Logs and metrics auto-ingested into OpenSearch and CloudWatch

## Principle Set

### 1. Everything as Code

- Infrastructure, configuration, policies, dashboards, and alerts must all be source-controlled.
- Use CDK or Terraform for AWS resources, and reuse shared modules across environments.

### 2. Continuous Integration by Default

- All repos must have pre-merge build and test pipelines.
- Linting, unit tests, and code coverage must run on every pull request.

### 3. Policy-as-Code

- Embed policy checks into pipelines (e.g., deny public S3 buckets, flag high-privilege IAM roles).
- Use tools like OPA, Checkov, or AWS Config Rules for automated enforcement.

### 4. Immutable Deployments

- All services must be deployed using versioned and immutable artifacts (e.g., containers, Lambda zips).
- Avoid patching live infrastructure directly.

### 5. Progressive Delivery

- Use feature flags and canary/blue-green deploys for risky changes.
- Validate success criteria before full rollout.

### 6. Secrets Management

- No hardcoded secrets in code or pipelines.
- Use AWS Secrets Manager or Parameter Store with IAM-scoped access.

### 7. Rollback and Recovery

- Every deployment must have rollback capability.
- Monitor and alert on error budgets, deployment failures, and circuit breakers.

### 8. Observability and Alerting

- Standardized logging (JSON) and tracing (e.g., AWS X-Ray) must be instrumented.
- Alerts should be actionable, deduplicated, and linked to dashboards and playbooks.

### 9. Cross-Environment Consistency

- Dev, staging, and prod should follow the same provisioning and pipeline templates.
- Drift must be detected and remediated automatically.

### 10. Fast Feedback Loops

- Pipeline durations must be optimized (target <10 min for CI).
- Fast test feedback enables frequent, safe releases and reduced cognitive load.
