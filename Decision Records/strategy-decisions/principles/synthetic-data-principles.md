## Purpose

This document outlines guiding principles for generating, managing, and using synthetic data within enterprise AI, analytics, and testing workflows. Synthetic data is created algorithmically to simulate real-world data without exposing sensitive or regulated information, while preserving statistical utility.

---

## 1. Privacy by Design

- Synthetic data must be generated without direct exposure to original personally identifiable information (PII), protected health information (PHI), or financial data.  
- Differential privacy, k-anonymity, or privacy-preserving GANs should be incorporated based on sensitivity.  
- Ensure irreversibility — synthetic data must not be used to infer or reconstruct original data records.

---

## 2. Purpose-Bound Generation

- Clearly define use cases (e.g., model training, test data, demo environments, internal innovation).  
- Tailor fidelity and complexity to the purpose — overfitting synthetic data may introduce bias or hallucinations.  
- Track lineage and metadata for every synthetic dataset generated.

---

## 3. Faithful Statistical Properties

- Synthetic data should preserve key distributions, correlations, and outlier behavior of the source domain.  
- Use statistical similarity metrics (e.g., Jensen–Shannon divergence, Kolmogorov–Smirnov test) to validate realism.  
- Periodically test against benchmark datasets and real production metrics.

---

## 4. Label Fidelity and Semantic Integrity

- In supervised tasks, synthetic data must maintain accurate label–feature relationships.  
- For NLP/vision tasks, synthetic outputs must pass human-in-the-loop or classifier-based semantic review.  
- Ensure that prompt-based generation for synthetic tasks doesn't reinforce harmful biases.

---

## 5. Traceability and Governance

- Maintain trace logs for synthetic dataset generation:  
  - Original schema reference  
  - Generation method (e.g., CTGAN, VAE, SMOTE)  
  - Date/time and requester  
- Tag and register synthetic datasets with compliance indicators.

---

## 6. Testing and Data Augmentation

- Use synthetic data to expand rare class representation or simulate edge conditions.  
- Never replace real data entirely — synthetic data should augment, not distort.  
- For model performance testing, use structured test scenarios based on synthetic inputs.

---

## 7. Tooling and Frameworks

- Prefer open-source and vetted libraries (e.g., SDV, Gretel.ai, Synthea).  
- Avoid “black-box” synthetic data vendors without transparency on generation mechanisms.  
- Incorporate data validation and drift checks post-generation.

---

## 8. Explainability and Documentation

- Document assumptions, transformation rules, and risk mitigations for each synthetic dataset.  
- Publish data sheets for synthetic datasets when used in model training or evaluation.  
- Make documentation available to risk, audit, and governance teams.

---

## 9. Risk Classification and Review

- High-risk domains (healthcare, finance, regulated verticals) require red-team review and approval.  
- Periodically test synthetic data for leakage or fidelity regression.  
- Establish a compliance gate before synthetic data can be used in production-adjacent workflows.

---

## 10. Ethics and Bias Monitoring

- Monitor synthetic generation pipelines for replication of real-world biases or toxic patterns.  
- Use adversarial validation to detect fairness or distribution drift.  
- Include DEI and ethics team review for sensitive datasets (e.g., gender, race, location).
