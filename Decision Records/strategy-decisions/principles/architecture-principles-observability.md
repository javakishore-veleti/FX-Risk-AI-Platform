# Observability Architecture Principles

## Ownership

- **Document Owner**: Chief Architect, Fx-Risk-AI Platform
- **Review Cadence**: Annual or after changes in telemetry stack, dashboards, or critical alert policies

## Audience

This document is intended for:

- Site Reliability Engineers (SREs)
- Platform Engineers
- Application Owners
- AI/ML Engineers (for inference traceability)
- Security and Compliance Teams

## Governance

- All services must provide end-to-end observability across logs, metrics, and traces.
- Observability requirements must be reviewed during architecture design and MVP readiness checks.
- Dashboards and alerts must be traceable to business SLAs and technical SLOs.

## Automation and Tooling Enablers

- **Standardized Logging**: JSON logs with trace IDs, user context, and service metadata
- **Metrics Collection**: Push to CloudWatch or OpenTelemetry collector
- **Tracing**: Use AWS X-Ray or OpenTelemetry to track flows across services
- **Dashboards**: Automated provisioning of dashboards per environment (via IaC)
- **Alert Routing**: Use Amazon SNS or PagerDuty with environment and service tags

## Principle Set

### 1. End-to-End Traceability

- Capture trace IDs from the UI to backend to LLM and back.
- Trace IDs must be stored in logs, responses, and error records.

### 2. Standardized Logging Format

- Use structured JSON logs with fields: timestamp, traceId, userId, requestId, latency, and status.
- Logs should be parsable by OpenSearch or a SIEM system.

### 3. SLO-Based Monitoring

- Define Service Level Objectives (SLOs) for each critical service.
- Monitor error budgets, request latencies, and system uptime.

### 4. Observable AI Workflows

- Log LLM prompt, response, model version, and user actions.
- Track hallucination rate, flagged responses, and feedback score over time.

### 5. Real-Time Alerting with Context

- Alerts must contain service, environment, severity, and runbook link.
- Minimize noise and avoid duplicate alerts across environments.

### 6. Unified Dashboards

- Every business capability (e.g., Forecasting, Exceptions, Orchestration) must have a shared dashboard.
- Include UI metrics, API response time, queue depth, and model latency.

### 7. Audit and Compliance Visibility

- Observability must support audit needs â€” include IAM role, IP address, and timestamp in key logs.
- Logs must be immutable and retained per compliance duration.

### 8. Environment-Specific Telemetry

- Use tags to isolate dev, test, and prod telemetry.
- Avoid noisy or debug logs in production environments.

### 9. Feedback Integration

- Allow end users to flag output errors and connect that to trace logs.
- Build workflows to close the loop on flagged events and track resolution time.

### 10. Cost-Efficient Telemetry

- Use log sampling or filtering for high-traffic services.
- Archive older logs to S3 and use tiered retention policies.
