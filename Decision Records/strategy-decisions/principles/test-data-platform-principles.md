# Test Data Platform Principles

**Owner**: Chief Data Officer (CDO)  
**Audience**: QA Engineers, DevOps, Data Engineers, AI/ML Engineers  
**Governance**: QA Center of Excellence, Data Governance Board  
**Automation**: Enforced through test data pipelines, environment scaffolding scripts, CI/CD policies

## Purpose

This document defines strategic principles for building and operating an enterprise-grade test data platform. The platform ensures that developers, testers, and ML teams have access to high-quality, policy-compliant, versioned, and secure test data that mimics production behavior without exposing sensitive information.

---

## 1. Separation of Test and Production Data

- No real production data should be used in lower environments (dev, QA, UAT) unless explicitly anonymized and approved.  
- All test data must come from controlled, governed, and versioned test data sources.  
- Test data refreshes must not be automatic unless validated.

---

## 2. Synthetic and Masked Data as First-Class Citizens

- Use synthetic data generators (SDG) or masking pipelines to create compliant, realistic test data.  
- Classify test data by type: masked, anonymized, synthetic, reference-only.  
- Use domain-aware generators to preserve semantics (e.g., date ranges, valid IDs, industry codes).

---

## 3. Policy-Driven Access and Usage

- Define who can generate, view, download, and use which test datasets.  
- Use RBAC and tagging (e.g., `region=EU`, `contains_PII=false`) to enforce regulatory scope.  
- Automatically deny tests that attempt to move or mix data across boundary constraints.

---

## 4. Versioned and Snapshot-Aware

- Test data should support snapshots (point-in-time) for repeatable test cases.  
- Enable rollback to prior versions of test data for regression testing.  
- Store metadata and changelogs for every dataset release.

---

## 5. Environment-Agnostic Provisioning

- Provision test data into dev, test, staging, and isolated sandboxes via APIs or IaC.  
- Use containerized or ephemeral volumes for test environments (e.g., with Docker, Terraform).  
- Ensure isolation to prevent data cross-contamination.

---

## 6. High-Fidelity with Production Semantics

- Match data shape, types, and referential integrity to production schema.  
- Simulate real-world edge cases and volume scenarios (e.g., long tail, time skew, multi-region).  
- Track data drift between production and test data over time.

---

## 7. Data Subsetting and Minimization

- Extract only what is needed for a test case â€” avoid large dumps.  
- Masked production subsets must pass privacy constraints.  
- Use intelligent sampling (e.g., stratified, rare class emphasis).

---

## 8. Test Data Observability

- Monitor who used what dataset, when, where, and for what purpose.  
- Audit logs must be immutable and reviewed periodically.  
- Alert on stale or unmaintained test datasets.

---

## 9. Integration with CI/CD

- Provide test data provisioning as a service during CI/CD workflows.  
- Block deployments or test runs if compliant test data is not provisioned.  
- Include validation and data health checks as part of pre-test gates.

---

## 10. Compliance and Lifecycle Management

- Classify all test datasets by risk (e.g., `public`, `internal`, `confidential`) and align lifecycle accordingly.  
- Automate expiry and destruction of temporary test datasets.  
- Archive high-value test datasets with full metadata and access history.
