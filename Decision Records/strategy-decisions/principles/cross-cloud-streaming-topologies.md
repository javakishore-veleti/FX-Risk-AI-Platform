# Cross-Cloud Streaming Topologies

## Ownership

- **Document Owner**: Chief Architect, Fx-Risk-AI Platform  
- **Review Cadence**: Semi-annually or during changes in integration zones or real-time workloads

## Audience

- Platform architects, DevOps, integration engineers  
- Cloud governance and security teams  
- Application teams interfacing across AWS, Azure, GCP

## Purpose

Enable consistent, secure, and reliable streaming across multiple clouds while preserving traceability, delivery guarantees, and schema governance.

---

## Key Scenarios Supported

1. AWS-based producers → Azure Event Hub consumers  
2. Azure LLM triggers → GCP-based data pipelines  
3. Kafka internal event bus → external delivery via Kinesis Firehose  
4. Real-time reconciliation → multi-cloud warehouse sync via Pub/Sub or Firehose

---

## Topology Patterns

### Pattern 1: Broker-to-Broker Relay

- Use Kafka MirrorMaker or Azure Event Grid → Event Hub bridge  
- Use schema passthrough with contract enforcement  
- Apply retry/delay buffers to absorb propagation failures

### Pattern 2: API-to-Stream Proxy

- Publish to cross-cloud stream via proxy API with internal service discovery  
- Use authenticated API Gateway with payload validation  
- Audit every invocation for traceability

### Pattern 3: Firehose or Dataflow Integration

- Use AWS Firehose to push enriched data to Azure Blob / GCS for downstream streaming  
- Schedule cross-region delivery with SLAs and record-level lineage

---

## Design Principles

- **Idempotency**: Every stream must support retry without duplication  
- **Traceability**: Maintain `trace_id`, `cloud_id`, `origin` metadata  
- **Compression**: Use GZIP or LZ4 to optimize inter-cloud bandwidth  
- **Security**: Encrypt in-transit via TLS; IAM role federation or token-based access required  
- **Cost Awareness**: Monitor inter-cloud traffic volume; throttle or queue when limits are approached

---

## Observability

- Use shared metrics formats (OpenTelemetry) to trace events across clouds  
- Unified dashboards show event lag, drop rate, and interconnect latency  
- Alert on schema mismatch, expired credentials, and throughput anomalies

---

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- Unversioned schemas across clouds  
- Public topic exposure without policy wrapping  
- Direct coupling of microservices to multi-cloud stream without abstraction  
- Rigid schemas without compatibility buffers (e.g., optional fields, oneof patterns)
