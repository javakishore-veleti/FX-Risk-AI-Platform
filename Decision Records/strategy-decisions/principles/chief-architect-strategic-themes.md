# Chief Architect — Strategic Themes and Focus Areas

## Ownership

- **Author**: Chief Architect, Fx-Risk-AI Platform
- **Review Cadence**: Quarterly or during strategic planning and governance cycles

## Audience

This document is intended for:

- CIO, CTO, and Chief Architect office
- Architecture Review Board (ARB)
- Platform and Domain Architects
- Engineering Leaders across desks

## Purpose

This document outlines the **strategic focus areas** for the Chief Architect role in guiding the Fx-Risk-AI platform’s architecture, execution, and transformation. These themes inform governance, prioritization, platform design, and technical decision making at scale.

## Strategic Themes

### 1. Business Alignment & Platform Thinking

- Tie every architecture initiative to a tangible business value: reduced SLA breaches, faster exception resolution, audit transparency, AI productivity.
- Evolve the platform as a modular set of business capabilities that serve multiple desks and teams.

### 2. “It Works” vs “It Transforms”

- Go beyond functional solutions — drive platform transformation through reusability, automation, and AI augmentation.
- Build for extensibility, not just execution: shared prompts, APIs, data routes, dashboards.

### 3. Cloud-Native & Serverless First

- Favor composable AWS services (Step Functions, Bedrock, Lambda, CDK).
- Simplify ops through infrastructure-as-code and policy-as-code.

### 4. AI as a Workflow Enabler

- Treat AI (LLMs, classifiers, forecasters) as plug-ins to decisions, not black boxes.
- Support traceability, prompt versioning, feedback loops, and fallback logic.

### 5. Data & Model Governance

- Every decision must be logged, explainable, and traceable back to user intent and system state.
- Ensure lineage from input (UI/API) → transformation (rules + AI) → output → audit.

### 6. Domain Modularity

- Architect using the principles of bounded contexts and desk-specific domains.
- Allow experimentation and MVPs within boundaries — orchestrate across desks with shared components.

### 7. Governance without Bottlenecks

- Apply architectural guardrails via CI checks, scorecards, and decision records — not synchronous meetings.
- Enable teams to self-serve documentation, standards, and approved templates.

### 8. DevEx and Multi-Tenant Enablement

- Build developer workflows with shared services, templates, and scalable pipelines.
- Support desk-level customizations (routing, UI, feature flags) without code duplication.

### 9. Audit-Ready from Day 1

- Embed explainability, trace logs, access controls, and retention in every service from design stage.
- Ensure each AI flow can pass internal or external audits without retrofitting.

### 10. MVP First, Architecture Always

- Ship fast through minimal viable architectures — with a path to scale and refactorability.
- Avoid one-off scripts or UI hacks; prefer orchestrated flows with monitoring and feedback.

## Summary

The Chief Architect role is not just about **technical depth**, but also about:

- Shaping platform-wide transformation
- Navigating tradeoffs in scale, cost, and governance
- Translating business themes into modular, cloud-native, AI-augmented architecture

These strategic principles guide how every system is designed, built, and evolved across the platform.
